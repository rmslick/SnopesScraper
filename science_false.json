At the time of this writing, the video had been liked more than 31,000 times.\n\u201cA local farmer was getting a new hole dug for a new thousand-gallon fuel tank, because with farmers it\u2019s easier to have the fuel brought to you\u2026 and as they were getting ready to dig the support columns for the foundation, they hit something \u2014 they didn\u2019t know what it was, so they called authorities,\u201d the man said.\n\u201cAuthorities came out and said, \u2018yep, that\u2019s bone but it was not a human bone.\u2019 So, they talked to a couple colleges, they sent some people out. They said, \u2018not only is it not human bone, it is a dinosaur bone,\u201d he added. \u201cNot only is it a dinosaur bone. It is probably the largest leg bone they\u2019ve ever found.

But there are several discrepancies in the video that make it difficult to track the accuracy of the claims made. Firstly, the original poster did not name the town in which the bone was reportedly discovered, nor did he state a time frame. He also did not name the institution or university that researchers were supposedly affiliated with. A look through media reports in June 2021 did not return results to the above answers.\nIf true, the news would certainly have been reported and commented on by the archaeology community, because according to the University of Illinois Extension, there is no record of dinosaur fossils ever having been discovered in the state. This is largely due to the historical geology and climate of the region. Near the end of the dinosaurs roughly 65 million years ago, North America looked much different than it does in the 21st century.\n\u201cA vast gulf of water separated most of eastern North America from the western mountains. North and South America were also separated by water,\u201d wrote the university. \u201cBecause of the warmer temperatures and ocean currents at that time, ice caps at the poles were not present.\u201d\nFossils that may have held the secrets to the species of dinosaurs that might have once inhabited the Land of Lincoln may have been eroded away over time, noted the university.\nOn June 8, NPR Illinois station 91.9 WUIS reported that researchers in Australia have confirmed the \u201cdiscovery of Australia\u2019s largest dinosaur species ever found.\u201d Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed journal PeerJ, the research team reported that the fossilized bones of Australotitan cooperensis were excavated in 2006 and 2007 and, after years of analysis, paleontologists from the Queensland Museum and Eromanga Natural History Museum were able to confirm that the animal measured about \u201c80 to 100 feet long and 16 to 21 feet tall at its hip. It weighed somewhere between 25 and 81 tons. For comparison, the Tyrannosaurus rex was about 40 feet long and 12 feet tall.\u201d (However, there was no mention of a fuel tank or a farm in that study.)\nSnopes contacted the University of Illinois Extension and the U.S. Geological Survey for further clarification about the supposed Illinois discovery but did not hear back in time for publication.\u00a0\nBut in late July, the Chicago Tribune identified the original poster as a man named Merf who lived north of Springfield in the small town of Sherman. In the article, reporter Christopher Borrelli noted that Merf had published subsequent videos in which claims to have applied for press credentials but needed to keep quiet because \u201cscience moves slowly.\u201d Eventually, though, the gag was up. Borrelli wrote:\u00a0\u00a0\nFinally, in late June, after four videos and a couple of weeks of updates, he posted a new video explaining he had just received a press release from the \u201cDepartment of Interior\u201d officially explaining the situation.

The report focused on what has come to be known as the \u201cHavana Syndrome,\u201d a series of seemingly related illnesses suffered by American and Canadian diplomats serving in Cuba. The original reporting included what later appeared to be speculation from unnamed United States government officials that some form of heretofore unknown sonic weapon was to blame:\n\nIn the fall of 2016, a series of U.S. diplomats began suffering unexplained losses of hearing, according to officials with knowledge of the investigation into the case. Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of President Barack Obama\u2019s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba.\nSome of the U.S. diplomats\u2019 symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said.

After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been attacked with an advanced sonic weapon that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences.\nThe U.S. State Department later walked back claims that they specifically had concluded a sonic weapon was at play, saying through a spokesperson that \u201cwe do not know who or what is causing these incidents\u201d. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described the incidents as \u201chealth attacks\u201d, and Cuba denies any involvement. As reported by the Associated Press on 18 September 2017, the range of symptoms is nonspecific and vague:\n\nOf the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, the AP has reported. Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential \u201csonic attack.\u201d Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms.\n\nOf the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, the AP has reported. Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential \u201csonic attack.\u201d Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms.\nIn sum, the symptoms (none of which are universal to all cases) that have been used in the defense of the claim that a \u201csonic weapon\u201d was used are as follows:\nAdditional clues into the nature of the attack, including the occurrence of an audible noise in some cases, were provided first by a 20 August 2017 CNN\u00a0report, reporting that some diplomats heard \u201ca deafeningly loud [but unidentified] sound similar to the buzzing created by insects or metal scraping across a floor\u201d. CBS News reported:\n\nSome felt vibrations, and heard sounds \u2014 loud ringing or a high-pitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas. Others heard the grinding noise.\n\nSome felt vibrations, and heard sounds \u2014 loud ringing or a high-pitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas. Others heard the grinding noise.\nThe reports of screeching noises in some cases and no noise in most cases initially fed both government and media speculation that a \u201csilent\u201d audible device was most likely used (there are ranges of noise close to audible sound that can be heard by some but not others). The two options, then, would be an infrasonic device (below the audible frequency humans hear) or an ultrasonic device (above that range).\nThe debate about which brand of inaudible noise would be used generally boils down to this: infrasonic waves capable of affecting humans covertly would need to be extremely close to the victim or unrealistically large, and they would not be able to produce a targeted attack, instead affecting a larger and thus more indiscriminate area. Ultrasonic waves could be targeted, focused, and beamed from further away, but are unlikely to cause a bulk of the symptoms ascribed to them and unless the device was physically touching the victim.\nBefore diving into this research, two\u00a0variables related to sound are necessary to understand what follows. These include the frequency of the noise \u2014\u00a0defined by the number of waves per unit of time \u2014 and also its power, determined by the amount of energy each wave carries. The former is reported in Hz or kHz, with infrasound including noise below 20 Hz, and ultrasound encompassing noise above 20 kHz (20,000 Hz). (The latter is reported in decibels or dB.)\nBelow, we detail the main research regarding the primary symptoms discussed in the reporting of the Cuban \u201chealth attacks\u201d, finding a.) that the evidence is fairly weak for both ultrasound and infrasound as the cause for a majority of the symptoms listed and b.) that none of the symptoms can be described entirely by either only infrasound or only ultrasound.\nHearing Loss \nThe source most commonly cited in news reports suggesting that infrasound can cause hearing loss is a 2001\u00a0review conducted by the NIH, which stated (with heavy qualification) that research, while sparse, shows \u201cphysical damage to the ear or some loss of hearing has been found in humans and/or animals at levels above 140 dB\u201d. The 140 dB measurement is no minor omission of detail, as 140 dB infrasonic waves projected covertly at any distance are essentially impossible. The actual studies reviewed in this NIH document generally suggest the opposite: low-frequency, high-power noise will not cause hearing loss, temporary or otherwise, if below the considerably high energy of 150 dB.\nUltrasonic sound is widely considered to be irrelevant to hearing loss. Another 2001\u00a0review by J\u00fcrgen Altmann, an acoustic weapons expert and physicist at Germany\u2019s Technische Universitaet Dortmund and who investigated the bulk of the literature up to that time, concluded that at ultrasound \u201cthe ear is essentially untouched\u201d if levels are below 140 dB.\nFatigue, Headaches, Ringing Ears, Vertigo, and Nausea \nBased on the reviews performed by both the NIH and by Altmann, there is no scientific consensus on fatigue, headaches, ringing ears, or vertigo as they apply to infrasonic noise. The only symptom in this category discussed as a possible result of infrasonic noise is nausea. Per the NIH:\n\nThere is no agreement about the biological activity of infrasound. Reported effects include [\u2026] nausea, vomiting, and bowel spasm.\u00a0\n\nThere is no agreement about the biological activity of infrasound. Reported effects include [\u2026] nausea, vomiting, and bowel spasm.\u00a0\nAltmann (and many others) argued that the gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, and bowel spasms in particular, while frequently reported in the press, have been overblown and cannot conclusively be tied to infrasonic sound:\n\nThe vertigo and nausea effects in the journalistic articles ascribed to intense infrasound cannot be confirmed. On the other hand, low [but still audible] frequencies of 50-100 Hz at 150 to 155 dB caused mild nausea.\n\nThe vertigo and nausea effects in the journalistic articles ascribed to intense infrasound cannot be confirmed. On the other hand, low [but still audible] frequencies of 50-100 Hz at 150 to 155 dB caused mild nausea.\nMany of the above symptoms (headaches, ringing ears, nausea, and fatigue), however, were once referred to in the literature as \u201cultrasonic sickness\u201d. This suite of symptoms and their ties to ultrasonic noise was based on numerous reports from workers in proximity to a variety of ultrasonic devices or tools. Altmann has argued that this literature is hard to interpret as these environments contain significant audible sound, as well. A 2013\u00a0review of the effects of ultrasound on humans makes a similar argument:\n\nMany studies confirmed the appearance of subjective symptoms of exposure to noise emitted by ultrasonic devices like dizziness, balance disturbances, tinnitus and fatigue. It is assumed that those symptoms result from the effect of noise on the vestibular system; however, further studies are necessary. [\u2026]\nAccording to the results of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201caudible\u201d components of the noise spectrum are, above all, responsible for subjective symptoms among workers exposed to noise emitted by ultrasonic devices.\n\nMany studies confirmed the appearance of subjective symptoms of exposure to noise emitted by ultrasonic devices like dizziness, balance disturbances, tinnitus and fatigue.

Within those, a few single\u00a0studies demonstrate a connection between infrasound and cognition on humans and animals. Overall, however, most research demonstrates no connection at all, and none have suggested permanent or persistent issues after exposure, as stated in the National Institutes of Health\u2019s\u00a02001\u00a0review:\n\nIn several experiments to assess cognitive performance during exposure to infrasound [\u2026] no reduction in performance was observed in the subjects. Sole exposure to infrasound at 10 to 15 Hz and 130 to 135 dB for 30 minutes also did not produce changes in autonomic nervous functions.\n\nIn several experiments to assess cognitive performance during exposure to infrasound [\u2026] no reduction in performance was observed in the subjects. Sole exposure to infrasound at 10 to 15 Hz and 130 to 135 dB for 30 minutes also did not produce changes in autonomic nervous functions.\nIn terms of ultrasound, the 2013\u00a0review noted that many concentration issues could be associated with the symptoms of \u201cultrasonic sickness\u201d without being directly caused by the noise itself:\n\nIt is worth mentioning that some subjective effects of exposure to ultrasonic noise such as fatigue, headache, discomfort or irritation may disturb human cognitive functions.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that some subjective effects of exposure to ultrasonic noise such as fatigue, headache, discomfort or irritation may disturb human cognitive functions.\nThis body of research refers to the transient appearance of these symptoms when in direct contact with that sound, and makes no suggestion of prolonged memory problems like word recall. Outside of occupational studies that lack relevance to sonic weapon development and by their nature include audible sound as well, there is little evidence in humans to suggest that ultrasound can be the cause for permanent neurological damage.\nMild Traumatic Brain Injury \nAltmann, author of the 2001 review of acoustic weapons, told the Associated Press:\n\nI know of no acoustic effect or device that could produce traumatic brain injury or concussion-like symptoms.\n\nI know of no acoustic effect or device that could produce traumatic brain injury or concussion-like symptoms.\nThe only real mechanism for a damage to the internal organ system such as the brain would be through some sort of powerful internal vibration caused by the strong vibration of the sound waves themselves. Scientists agree that this would best be achieved by infrasound, but the evidence that such frequencies could actually make this happen is quite limited and derived almost entirely from studies on animals or anecdotal\u00a0reports.\nA 2009\u00a0review published in the journal Military Medicine notes that \u201cremarkable properties have been attributed to infrasound, including the capacity to \u2018debilitate people for hours and even days,\u2019 with \u2018pulsing in their internal organs and blurred vision, both of which can lead to \u2026, in rare cases, death,'\u201d but this review also highlights the reality that there are nearly no studies to back up such claims. In fact, studies performed as far back as 1978 and as recently as 2009 conclude that an infrasonic weapon used to harm major organ systems would be implausible \u2014 if not completely impossible.\nIn terms of ultrasound, it is essentially impossible for this kind of energy to penetrate into the human body without direct contact, as the waves dissipate rapidly through the air (and, it should be noted, pretty rapidly within the body as well). Responding to questions that ultrasonic waves could cause brain damage,\u00a0 Robin Cleveland, a professor of engineering science at the University of Oxford, told the Guardian he doesn\u2019t buy it: \u201cThe sound would have to enter the brain tissue itself [\u2026]. If there\u2019s even a tiny bit of air between the sound and your body it doesn\u2019t get through.\u201d\nBlood Disorders\nWithout knowing more than that a victim experienced \u201ca more serious illness that involved a blood disorder\u201d it is hard to confidently assess plausibility of this this kind of disease except to say that the reasons ultrasonic noise do not explain brain damage would likely hold for any illness that requires sound to penetrate into the body. According to the NIH, the most consistently reported effect of infrasonic noise (though the mechanisms remains unclear) seem to be changes in blood pressure and respiratory rate, which could perhaps be linked to other diseases indirectly. There is no existing evidence that links noise of any kind to the development of a blood disorder.\nIn the End, Neither Infrasound or Ultrasound Work as an Explanation\nTaking even the most tenuous scientific research at face value, an ultrasonic device could be responsible for the transient occurrence of fatigue, headaches, ringing ears, vertigo, and nausea and (even more dubious) concentration and memory issues. Taking a similarly loose approach for infrasound, this kind of noise could cause hearing loss, nausea, and (most dubiously) some form of organ discomfort or damage. Neither can explain all of the symptoms.\nFurther, there is no real way to create a covert version of either device. F. Joseph Pompei, a former MIT researcher and current chief executive officer of a company that develops devices that focus sound into narrow, targeted beams, told us that a focused or controllable beam of 20Hz (infrasonic) sound would require an array of subwoofers \u201cthe size of a stadium\u201d.\u00a0\nConversely, he told us, for an ultrasonic device to penetrate into the body at all, the victim would either have to be submerged in water or have the device in physical contact (both conditions would allow those waves to pass into the body without reflecting off it). This, as well, seems unlikely to be a covert choice for an attack.\n\u201cIt sounds very appealing and interesting, but I find it hard to believe that there actually is such a device,\u201d \u00a0John Oghalai, Chair of the Caruso Department of Otolaryngology \u2013 Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Southern California, told The Verge.\nCollectively, the scientific research \u2014 which in many cases notes that anecdotal and inaccurate reports in newspapers have long obfuscated the actual science behind the plausibility of such a device \u2014 demonstrates that no single brand of sound could create the range of symptoms described by the victims of the Cuban health attacks, and even if they could, a covert device would be hard if not impossible to design. As such we rank the specific claim that an inaudible sonic device adequately explains the health attacks in Cuba as false.\nOn 1 September 2018, the New York Times reported on a theory the government is said to be considering as a cause of the health attacks on American and other diplomats in Cuba: focused beams of microwave energy that can cause both brain damage and the perception of noises when such noises do not exist. This effect, the Times reported, has been known to science since 1961 as the Frey effect or the microwave auditory effect. In a 2017 paper, electrical engineering professor James Lin suggested this phenomenon could explain the events in Havana:\nSome readers may find it preposterous or astonishing that auditory perception of (or hearing) microwave pulses is possible. So let me explain. Studies have shown that the auditory phenomenon occurs at a microwave radiation specific-energy-absorption rate threshold of 1.6 W/g for a single 10-\u03bcs-wide pulse of microwaves aimed at the subject or subject\u2019s head, for example. Most significantly, high-power microwave pulses may be covertly delivered remotely, so that only the intended target would perceive the sound in his or her own head \u2026\nDepending on the intensity of the impinging microwave pulses, the level of induced sound pressure could be considerably above the threshold of auditory perception at the cochlea\u2014 approaching or exceeding levels of discomfort (including the reported headaches, ringing in the ears, nausea, and problems with balance or vertigo) and even causing potential tissue injury.\nSome readers may find it preposterous or astonishing that auditory perception of (or hearing) microwave pulses is possible.

Smith, the lead author on a March 2018 paper about the Cuban health attacks and the director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania, said that \u201cmicrowaves were now considered a main suspect.\u201d The Times also cited \u201ca secretive group of elite scientists that helps the federal government assess new threats to national security\u201d assuggesting that the microwave theory is among those being considered. The weaponization of this technology, the Times reported, has been of interest to both the United States and the former Soviet Union.\nThe Cuban government, via a CNN interview with a member of the Cuban task force investigating the attacks, has pushed back against this theory, suggesting it belongs in the realm of science fiction and that it is inconsistent with the reported circumstances described by the victims:\n\u201cIf you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted. This is a kind of weapon that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a well-known neurologist who is part of the Cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks. \u201cIt\u2019s science fiction, not science,\u201d he said.\n\u201cFirst, it was sonic weapons, now microwave. What\u2019s next, kryptonite?\u201d the investigator said in an interview with CNN at his research center in Havana, referring to an earlier theory that sonic weapons emitting high-powered ultrasound waves could have caused the injuries.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted.

CNN reported that the Cuban government is currently working on a rebuttal to the microwave theory."}, "3": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/stonehenge-daylight-saving/", "title": "\tIs Stonehenge Reset for Daylight Saving Time?", "subtitle": "\t\tIt's time to set your clocks \u2014 and move your rocks \u2014 according to this internet meme. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Evon\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["15 March 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/03/stonehenge.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe stones at Stonehenge are moved every year to accommodate for daylight saving time. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nAs sure as people are to set their clocks forward in the spring for daylight savings time, social media users are sure to circulate a meme claiming that a similar ritual is taking place at Stonehenge.

In fact, on April Fools\u2019 Day in 2016, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty published a video showing how the stone\u2019s at Avebury had to be moved every year to accommodate for daylight saving time:\nAccording to the Border Sundials, a company that hand-makes sundials, the best way to deal with daylight saving time for sundial owners is to simply mentally add an hour.

In another video from the same air show, the announcer can be heard informing the crowd that the plane is close to the speed of sound, but the pilots were careful not to surpass it:\nAs the announcer explained, that\u2019s because the resulting sonic boom would be so powerful that it would leave a wave of destruction. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) bans most supersonic flight over or near land.\nAs anyone who lives in the flight path of a space shuttle has learned by experience, sonic booms are not only extremely loud, they cause the ground to shake.\nIn 2014, a U.S. Navy F-18 jet flying over the Pacific Ocean about 35 miles southwest of San Diego went supersonic. The resulting sonic boom led residents miles away in Orange and Los Angeles counties to believe they had experienced an earthquake. The sonic boom from a meteor that struck the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 also caused widespread damage.\nSonic booms are shock waves from air pressure and occur when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, which depending on various conditions, is about 761 mph.\nAlthough some posts and comments on social media indicated that viewers believed the circular cloud that formed around the F-18 at the 2009 air show was evidence of the plane going supersonic, it\u2019s not. The cloud is known as a vapor cone, or sometimes called a \u201cshock collar\u201d or \u201cshock egg,\u201d per the BBC, which published an explainer on the phenomenon in 2016.\nThe cone forms when airplanes approach the speed of sound, particularly if they are flying low over water. Even so, it\u2019s not visual evidence that the plane is breaking the sound barrier, per the BBC:\nThe vapour cones are created by a shockwave that is generated by the aircraft as it picks up speed. The shock waves are the physical effects of the aircraft travelling so fast through air. As the aircraft picks up speed, and approaches the speed of sound \u2013 around 767mph (1,234km/h) at sea level \u2013 shockwaves form around the aircraft. Across these shockwaves there is \u2018discontinuity\u2019 in the local air pressure and temperature. This causes the air to lose its capacity to hold water and condensation starts to form, creating the vapour cone.\nThe vapour cones are created by a shockwave that is generated by the aircraft as it picks up speed.

This causes the air to lose its capacity to hold water and condensation starts to form, creating the vapour cone.\nThe BBC also noted that the visual effect can be more dramatic when some of the air flowing around parts of the plane actually do pick up speeds faster than sound, an event known as a \u201ctransonic\u201d flight.\nSupersonic travel is currently limited to military flights and NASA shuttles, although from 1976 until 2003, civilian air passengers with deep pockets could make transatlantic flights aboard Concordes, commercial planes that traveled at supersonic speeds. Regulations banning supersonic flights over land because of sonic booms was one of the contributing factors that led to the final grounding of Concordes in 2003."}, "5": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/glowing-firefly-trees/", "title": "\tAre Scientists \u2018Literally Creating Glow-in-the-Dark Trees\u2019 With Firefly DNA?", "subtitle": "\t\tA TikTok video made an impressive number of false statements in 15 seconds.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["4 February 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/02/glowing-trees.png?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tDutch scientists literally created glow-in-the-dark trees by inserting genetic material from fireflies, making them \"eco-friendly outdoor nightlights.\" \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn a Jan. 30, 2021, TikTok video, user niklongo blew the minds of his collective audience with a purported scientific development by Dutch scientists:\nYou wanna have your mind blown?\nDutch scientists have located and isolated the gene that makes fireflies able to glow, recombined the DNA, and put that DNA in plants, literally creating glow-in-the-dark trees. Eco-friendly outdoor nightlights!\nFollow for more!\nYou wanna have your mind blown?\nDutch scientists have located and isolated the gene that makes fireflies able to glow, recombined the DNA, and put that DNA in plants, literally creating glow-in-the-dark trees. Eco-friendly outdoor nightlights!\nFollow for more!\nBroadly speaking, these claims stem primarily from confused and overhyped reporting that, at the time of the TikTok video, was over six years old. While scientists have inserted genes into plants that create a faint glow, glowing trees remain theoretical. The imagery used in the video stems from artwork inspired by \u2014 but not created with \u2014 this largely theoretical technology. Below, we break down all the problems with the assertions in the video:\nTwo words in, and already we are in trouble. The video asserts that \u201cDutch scientists\u201d are responsible for locating and isolating the gene that \u201cmakes fireflies able to glow.\u201d This is incorrect. The video\u2019s Dutch connection is an artist and designer named Daan Roosegaarde who did not actually locate or isolate any genes, or put said genes in a tree. Some of the images used in the TikTok video were created by Roosegaarde, but these were created by literally shining lights on trees as part of an art installation called \u201cGlowing Nature.\u201d\nIn 2014, Roosegaarde received a splash of U.S. media coverage while promoting his work at that year\u2019s SXSW festival in Austin, TX. During an interview in which he discussed using biologically inspired technology to solve environmental problems, he explained that the idea of using glowing trees as street lamps was inspired in part by the work of former SUNY Stony Brook professor Alexander Krichevsky, who in 2011 left his academic post to start a company named Bioglow. The company \u201cdeveloped the world\u2019s first autoluminescent (light producing) plants,\u201d according to an archived version of the company\u2019s website.\nBioglow apparently no longer exists, but it did produce and sell a limited run of faintly glowing plants. Unlike the imagery shown in the TikTok, the glowing effect in these plants was significantly more modest. \u201cSome people \u2026 over 40 may not be able to see the glow,\u201d explained a Bioglow promotional video from August 2015:\nIn the 2014 SXSW video, Roosegaarde held one of these early Bioglow plants as an example of biomimicry that inspires his art. Several reporters apparently falsely concluded that the Bioglow plant was an invention that Roosegaarde conceived of and helped to develop. This does not appear to be accurate. While some reports suggested there were or are theoretical plans for the artist and the scientist to collaborate on \u201ca really large [autoluminescent plant] like a tree which glows at night instead of standard street lighting,\u201d there is no indication anything came of this collaboration, if it materialized at all.\nContact information for Krichevsky was not readily apparent. We reached out to Roosegaarde\u2019s studio for more information on their work together and will update our piece if we receive new information.\u00a0\nContrary to the claim in the TikTok video, the creation of genetically modified glowing plants does not, at any point, introduce genes sourced from fireflies. Part of the confusion is that several academic or commercial enterprises are attempting, or have attempted, to create glowing plants. All of these efforts involve, in some way, the chemical luciferase, which reacts with a group of chemicals termed luciferins in a way that generates light. This chemical mechanism, generally speaking, is responsible for bioluminescence in several organisms, including fireflies.\nSeveral glowing plant projects attempt to create luminescence by directly injecting or applying luciferins and luciferase into or on them. One of the most notable efforts using this sort of methodology comes from the laboratory of Michael Strano, a professor of chemical engineering at MIT developing a nanoparticle delivery mechanism. These efforts have also received significant (and more recent) media coverage, but this work is not actually genetic engineering.\nAs far as we are aware, the only person to attempt to use genetic engineering to create glowing plants is Krichevsky. The central difference in his approach compared to those that apply luciferin-related chemicals is that Krichevsky\u2019s plants are autoluminescent. In other words, he modified the genes of a plant in a way that allows it to create its own luciferins and luciferase.\nHowever, the genetic material inserted into the plant\u2019s genome does not come from fireflies. Krichevsky published his methodology for engineering his plants in a 2010 paper. The genes it uses are sourced from the bioluminescent marine bacteria Photobacterium leiognathi. In neither method would it be accurate to say genes are isolated \u201cfrom fireflies.\u201d\nA commonly invoked vision for people involved in glowing plant research is a future where energy consumption is reduced thanks to glowing trees that could serve as self-powered streetlamps.\nSpeaking to the outlet Dezeen in 2014, Krichevsky explained, \u201cIn the long term we see use of glowing plants in contemporary lighting design, namely in landscaping and architecture as well as in transportation, marking driveways and highways with natural light that does not require electricity.\u201d\nIn an article introducing his SXSW interview a few months later, Dezeen introduced Roosegaarde as someone \u201cexploring ways of using bioluminescent bacteria found in jellyfish and mushrooms to create glow-in-the-dark trees that could replace street lights.\u201d\n\u201cOur target is to perform one treatment when the plant is a seedling or a mature plant, and have it last for the lifetime of the plant,\u201d Strano said in the 2017 MIT Press release. \u201cOur work very seriously opens up the doorway to streetlamps that are nothing but treated trees, and to indirect lighting around homes.\u201d\nIn none of these cases, however, did these individuals literally create a glowing tree. The technology simply is not there yet. Krichevsky\u2019s plants were not trees, but instead modified tobacco plants, which are commonly used in genetic research. The imagery used in the TikTok video comes from either art installations made by Roosegaarde which only mimicked the technology, or from computer-generated concept art, not literal glowing trees. Sadly.\nBecause glowing trees do not (yet) exist, because firefly genes are not used in this area of research, and because the work is falsely attributed to \u201cDutch scientists,\u201d the claims presented in niklongo\u2019s TikTok are \u201cFalse.\u201d"}, "6": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/asymptomatic-covid-patients/", "title": "\tDid Scientists Conclude Asymptomatic COVID Patients Can\u2019t Spread Virus?", "subtitle": "\t\tA website alleged a study found \"asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 didn't occur at all.\"\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJessica Lee\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["31 December 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/12/GettyImages-1211936198-scaled-e1609444686810.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tIn late 2020, scientists published studies that proved presymptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients do not spread the virus in any setting.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nAt the end of 2020, critics of government-imposed lockdowns on U.S. businesses and schools to prevent the spread of COVID-19 circulated posts alleging a new study found people who tested positive for the virus but did not show symptoms were not contagious.\n\nThe posts framed the alleged research as evidence that rules on social distancing in public spaces, such as restaurants and schools, were unnecessary given the assumption that symptomatic COVID-19 patients would stay home to rest, regardless of lockdown measures.\nAround the same time, a website, LifeSiteNews, published the following headline supposedly reporting similar findings of a separate study out of Wuhan, China: \u201cAsymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 didn\u2019t occur at all, study of 10 million finds.\u201d\n\nNumerous Snopes readers contacted us to investigate the validity of the purported research and to determine whether scientists indeed concluded asymptomatic or presymptomatic COVID-19 patients did not transmit the virus to others.\nFirstly, we will summarize the scope and objectives of both research projects. Researchers with doctorate degrees in biostatistics from the University of Florida, University of Washington, and Seattle\u2019s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center authored the Dec. 14 analysis to which conservative commentator Tomi Lahren refers in the above-displayed tweet criticizing lockdown restrictions.\nRather than conducting physical experiments or observing themselves, the scientists compiled 54 already-existing studies, including more than 78,000 people for their conclusions.\nBut here\u2019s a widely misrepresented element of the research: The studies to which the scientists referred did not look at how the virus spreads from person to person in public settings. Rather, the research interrogated how, or to what severity, members of the same household pass the virus to each other. The report obtained by Snopes via the American Medical Association\u2018s JAMA Network read:\nThe World Health Organization China Joint Mission reported human-to-human transmission in China largely occurred within families, accounting for 78% to 85% of clusters in Guangdong and Sichuan provinces. [\u2026]\nThe household secondary attack rate characterizes virus transmissibility. Studies can collect detailed data on type, timing, and duration of contacts and identify risk factors associated with infectiousness of index cases and susceptibility of contacts. Our objective was to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in households and determine factors that modify this parameter.\nThe World Health Organization China Joint Mission reported human-to-human transmission in China largely occurred within families, accounting for 78% to 85% of clusters in Guangdong and Sichuan provinces.

Our objective was to estimate the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in households and determine factors that modify this parameter.\nIn other words, it was a false characterization of the report, no mater its findings, to frame it as proof of how the virus spreads in any setting other than homes.\nThat mischaracterization aside, however, the claim that no asymptomatic or presymptomatic patient passed the virus on, or that the research proved that only symptomatic COVID-19 patients perpetuated the pandemic, were the most egregious errors in the claim casting doubt on lockdowns.\nBy analyzing the dozens of studies, the scientists concluded symptomatic patients carried the highest risk of spreading the virus to other people, yet a small number of people appeared to have caught the virus from patients without symptoms. The report read:\nWe found significantly higher secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases, although less data were available on the latter. The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable. However, presymptomatic transmission does occur, with some studies reporting the timing of peak infectiousness at approximately the period of symptom onset.\u00a0\nWe found significantly higher secondary attack rates from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic or presymptomatic index cases, although less data were available on the latter. The lack of substantial transmission from observed asymptomatic index cases is notable. However, presymptomatic transmission does occur, with some studies reporting the timing of peak infectiousness at approximately the period of symptom onset.\u00a0\nThe finding\u2019s emphasis on the lack of data on the particular matter (comparing symptomatic transmission spread with the rate of other patients) matched a Nov. 18 analysis by scientist journalist Bianca Nogrady in Nature Communications. It said:\nNow, evidence suggests that about one in five infected people will experience no symptoms, and they will transmit the virus to significantly fewer people than someone with symptoms. But researchers are divided about whether asymptomatic infections are acting as a \u2018silent driver\u2019 of the pandemic.\nNow, evidence suggests that about one in five infected people will experience no symptoms, and they will transmit the virus to significantly fewer people than someone with symptoms. But researchers are divided about whether asymptomatic infections are acting as a \u2018silent driver\u2019 of the pandemic.\nNonetheless, public health officials urged all people to wear masks and practice social distancing until scientists learn more about how respiratory droplets containing the virus spread among all types of infected people.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) stresses on its website that all infected people \u2014 regardless of whether they show symptoms \u2014 can spread COVID-19. \u201cWhile someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area,\u201d WHO stated at the time of this report.\nMeanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control reported on Nov. 20 that scientists estimated asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients accounted for more than 50% of the virus\u2019 transmissions.\nNow, let us look at the Nov. 20 study cited in the article on LifeSiteNews, which describes itself as a pro-life news site for Catholics. We found the original version of the paper via the scientific journal Nature Communications.\nPer that edition, two dozen scientists looked at how the virus did or did not impact 9,899,828 Wuhan residents between May 14 and June 1 \u2014 more than a month after the government lifted its lockdown to curb the outbreak. According to WHO, the city\u2019s restrictions were the strictest in the world, prohibiting all traveling, monitoring out-and-about residents at checkpoints at road junctions, and requiring everyone to self isolate.\nThat said, it was a misrepresentation of the study\u2019s findings \u2014 no matter what they were \u2014 to frame them as applicable to the United States, where a patchwork of county and state governments issued a range of policies to contain the virus. For examples, a portion of local jurisdictions implemented mandatory stay-at-home orders (the closest lockdowns to Wuhan\u2019s), while others issued advisories or recommendations for people to avoid unnecessary traveling or did nothing of the sort. Additionally, some of those restrictions remained in effect as of this report.\nThe scientists found that, of Wuhan\u2019s roughly 10 million residents, the vast majority did not test positive for COVID-19. Of the approximately 300 people who did test positive, none displayed any symptoms.\nThen, using tracing technology, the research group analyzed the health conditions of 1,174 people who spent time with the 300 asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients. No one within that group of some 1,200 people tested positive.\nIn sum, while the studies proved the rate of transmission between presymptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients appeared to be lower than that of symptomatic patients, the research did not confirm that infected people carry no risk of spreading the virus. In fact, public health officials say all COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether they show symptoms, are contagious. For those reasons, we rate this claim \u201cFalse.\u201d"}, "7": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/unobtainium-real/", "title": "\tIs \u2018Unobtainium\u2019 a Real Element?", "subtitle": "\t\tIf it were, where would we be able to obtain it?\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["17 December 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/12/GettyImages-532288536-scaled.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA substance dubbed \"unobtainium\" is a real chemical or a valid element included in the periodic table.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nA common trope in science fiction stories is the invocation of an element or chemical with properties that allow for something that, in science reality, would be physically impossible. Cleverly dubbed \u201cunobtainium\u201d or sometimes \u201cunobtanium,\u201d it is, from a factual standpoint, literally unobtainable due to its marked lack of being real. It is also occasionally used, in some circles, as a placeholder term for a substance needed, but not yet discovered, to solve a scientific problem.\u00a0\nThe 2003 film \u201cThe Core\u201d featured a submarine-like vessel that traveled on a journey to Earth\u2019s core. That machine was capable of withstanding the immense pressure of Earth\u2019s interior because it was built with \u201cunobtainium.\u201d In this film, the substance became stronger in the face of increased heat and pressure. In reality, the most heat resistant substance known to humans, hafnium carbide, has a melting point of 3000 degrees Celsius, which is significantly cooler than the temperature of Earth\u2019s inner core, estimated to be around 6000 C.\nIn the 2009 film \u201cAvatar,\u201d humans colonized a moon in the Alpha Centauri system to mine a valuable mineral named \u201cunobtainium.\u201d In this film, the substance was valuable because it was a superconductor that operated at room temperature. A superconductor is a substance that is able to conduct electricity without any resistance. They have crucial applications in several scientific and medical technologies, among other things. Their central drawback is the requirement of extremely cold temperatures to achieve this chemical state. A room-temperature superconductor would indeed be immensely valuable. Unfortunately, the closest thing humanity has gotten to discovering such a substance is one that requires pressures comparable to those found in the Earth\u2019s core.\nIn any event, unobtainium, whatever impossibility it is meant to solve in a film or book, is not a real chemical nor is it an element. It is, however, superficially similar-looking in name to the temporary name given to a once-theoretical element with an atomic number of 118 \u2014 ununoctium and other once unnamed elements. Russian scientists synthesized a few atoms of ununoctium in 2002. Following international confirmation of the Russian efforts, ununoctium was given a permanent name oganesson in 2015.\nAs it stands, no element is named unobtainium, and no chemical possesses the kinds of properties that have been ascribed to such a substance.

This phenomenon is quite common and appears about every 15 years.\nMars did make an extraordinarily close approach to Earth 17 years ago, culminating on 27 August 2003, when the red planet came within 35 million miles (or 56 million kilometers) of Earth, its nearest approach to us in almost 60,000 years. At that time, Mars appeared approximately 6 times larger and 85 times brighter in the sky than it ordinarily does. (One version of the message was often reproduced with an unfortunate line break, leaving some readers with the mistaken impression that Mars would \u201clook as large as the full moon to the naked eye\u201d without realizing that that statement only applied to those viewing Mars through a telescope with 75-power magnification.)\nAlthough Mars\u2019 proximity to Earth in August 2003 (referred to as a perihelic opposition) was a rare occurrence, the red planet comes almost as near to us every 15 to 17 years. To the unaided observer, Mars\u2019 appearance in August 2003 wasn\u2019t significantly larger or brighter than it is during those much more common intervals of closeness.\nMars had another close encounter with Earth in 2005, but that occurrence took place in October (not August), and the red planet appeared about 20% smaller than it did during similar circumstances in 2003. Mars also made a close approach to Earth in December 2007, but even then it was still about 55 million miles away from us, not nearly as close as it was in 2003 or 2005.\nThe closest encounter between Mars and Earth since 2003 occurred on 27 July 2018, when the orbits of the two planets brought them to within 35.8 million miles of each other. Astronomers predicted Mars would appear twice as bright as usual around that time (though it was certainly not expected to rival the brightness or size of the full moon).\nThe 2003 opposition will hang onto the record for the closest approach of Mars to Earth until 2287, when it is estimated the planets will be separated by 34.6 million miles.\nTexas astronomer Torvald Hessel observed the following in a 2006 interview about the perennial \u201cMars Spectacular\u201d message:\nQ: What\u2019s the truth?\nA: Mars gets close to Earth every two years.

Reports have since circulated the internet, incorrectly lumping sage into a long ingredient list that included dried roots and leaves tested as part of the experiment.\n\u201cThis is highly controversial since breathing in smoke has known harms, yet the antibacterial benefits are uncertain,\u201d Dean of Yale School of Public Health Dr. Sten Vermund told Snopes. Vermund added that there is no evidence that burning sage kills either bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the severe respiratory disease COVID-19.\nAs part of the 2007 study, researchers from the National Botanical Research Institute in India burned medicinal smoke from havan samagri within a confined space to determine whether certain herbs contained antimicrobial properties. Havan samagri is a \u201cmixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs\u201d that contains dozens of various types of wood, herbs, fruit and seeds used in Vedic Hindu tradition. However, sage was not included in the study\u2019s ingredient list. One hour of burning havan samagri was shown to kill more than 94% of airborne bacteria \u2013 and the effects were not short-lived. The evidence further suggested that medicinal smoke had the ability to \u201cpurify\u201d or \u201cdisinfect\u201d the air for up to 24 hours in a closed room. Even after a month, the researchers found that certain pathogenic bacteria were still absent from the room, such as those that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.\nThough it appears havan samagri may have some antimicrobial properties when burned, the findings do not suggest its use has any impact on viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This is, in part, due to the biological differences between bacteria and viruses. The Mayo Clinic notes that bacteria are capable of thriving in \u201cmany different types of environments\u201d whereas viruses require living hosts to multiply.\u00a0\n\nThe way that COVID-19 spreads and how long it is present in the air also plays a role. The virus is known to transmit via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby.\nEvidence also suggests that the virus spreads when an individual touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose, though recently published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caution that \u201cthis is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces and research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggests the virus may last at least several hours and up to three days on certain surfaces. Different surfaces and different conditions \u2013 such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and air movements \u2013 may see different results. Higher humidity, higher temperature, more airflow, and more sunlight or UV light are less-than-ideal conditions for SARS-CoV-2.\n\u201cThis is subject of uncertainty and will differ for indoor and outdoor spaces. Certain \u2018super-spreader\u2019 events have suggested that individuals in the wrong place (i.e. poorly ventilated indoor spaces) at the wrong time may mean considerable risk. But as a rule of thumb, aerosols can disperse across an indoor space,\u201d explained Vermund.\nThe CDC recommends using a combination of soap, water, and surface disinfectants identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sanitize spaces for the COVID-19 virus. Vermund added that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations can also be adjusted or increased to spur great air circulation.\n\u201cIn the absence of an HVAC system in a building, strategic and well-planned outward-facing fans can be placed in windows to create a negative pressure area (as one sees in some kitchens and attics) that can decrease levels of virus in the air,\u201d said Vermund. \u201cOf course, mask use, physical distancing, hand/face/surface hygiene, outdoor activities, small crowds, and testing and contact tracing are all vital.\u201d\nThough sage is not known to eliminate airborne bacteria or viruses, the herb has been shown to contain antiseptic properties that are beneficial to human health. Previous research has found that sage mouthwash effectively reduced the number of mouth bacteria and may work as an effective treatment for certain mental health conditions, diabetes, and cancer. Further studies have shown that sage includes anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, among other health benefits.\nSmudging is an ancient ritual that holds both cultural and practical significance whereby a person burns certain plants in an effort to cleanse space. In early Indian writing dating between the 6th and 8th centuries BCE, it was believed that fumigating an operating room by burning mustard, butter, and salt was an early form of \u201cantisepsis,\u201d yet it was also practiced to keep evil spirits away, according to a 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Otology. Similarly, a 2020 study published in the journal Tel Aviv described the chemical residue of marijuana and frankincense discovered at a 2,000-year-old limestone altar in modern Israel. It was thought that both were burned as a way to administer their therapeutic benefits when ceremonial participants inhaled smoke."}, "10": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-brief-cia-in-2005/", "title": "\tDid Bill Gates Brief the CIA in 2005 About a Mind-Altering Vaccine?", "subtitle": "\t\tA years-old hoax recirculated in 2020 \u2014 this time with Gates' name attached to it. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Evon\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["21 May 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/05/Featured-Image-Templates-4.png?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA video shows Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates briefing the CIA in 2005 about a mind-altering vaccine. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn May 2020, a video (below) supposedly showing Microsoft Co-founder Bill Gates briefing the CIA about a mind-altering vaccine was circulated on social media.\nBut the presenter in this footage is not Gates.

Her team alleged to have demonstrated an association between a newly discovered retrovirus called \u201cxenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus\u201d (XMRV) and the poorly understood condition known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), suggesting a potential viral cause for CFS.\nThe paper received substantial international coverage. However, as with so many other potentially groundbreaking studies, nobody \u2014 including many of the same researchers involved with the original study \u2014 was able to replicate its results. Numerous attempts failed to replicate the study, and the research itself came under increasing scrutiny for sloppy methods and its reliance on misleading or manufactured figures.\nOn 1 July 2011, Science\u2019s editors issued a \u201cstatement of concern\u201d about the paper. On 14 October 2011, the authors issued a partial retraction of their paper that touched on issues with some of their figures. Finally, on 23 December 2011, the editors of Science retracted the paper in full:\nScience is fully retracting the Report \u201cDetection of an infectious retrovirus, XMRV, in blood cells of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome\u201d.

The two figures, which are used to describe different results, look identical, except for the labeling.\nThe scientist behind a study that linked chronic fatigue syndrome to a virus has lost her job and is now facing accusations that she has misrepresented data.

The judge removed himself from the case because he received campaign donations from WPI co-founder Harvey Whittemore, who himself has been criminally charged with making illegal campaign contributions to a federal official \u2026\nAssistant District Attorney John Helzer, who filed the dismissal, says Whittemore\u2019s legal troubles factored into his decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on with the federal government and different levels that wasn\u2019t occurring when we first became involved with prosecuting this case,\u201d says Helzer. \u201cAnd we have witness issues that have arisen.\u201d\nOn 11 June, the district attorney\u2019s office for Washoe County filed a petition to dismiss the criminal charges against Mikovits without prejudice (which means they can file a related complaint in the future), a clerk to the Justice Court of Reno told ScienceInsider.\nMikovits, who was briefly jailed on the charges, is still defending herself in the civil case, which has taken several bizarre twists, including a judge who had ruled against Mikovits recusing himself.

For example, the website \u201cReal Farmacy\u201d described Mikovits\u2019 saga as follows in a 28 November 2018 post:\nIf you have been following stories in recent years of scientists and researchers who make discoveries that are threatening to the Deep State and the bottom line of Big Pharma, you will have seen the pattern before. Those doctors are often \u2018persuaded\u2019 to recant their studies, offered bribes or other benefits to distance themselves from or even destroy their data, and even threatened with jail time or, if a legal case is too difficult to fabricate against them, they may simply be killed.\nSuch is the tale of molecular biologist Judy A. Mikovits, PhD, in the disturbing true story first detailed in this Natural News article that included the video below of how she was thrown in prison for research that led to the discovery that deadly retroviruses have been transmitted to twenty-five million Americans through human vaccines \u2026 It was not long after the implications from the paper became clear and the Deep State saw the threat that was being posed to the vaccine industry that their powerful mechanisms of cover-up, obfuscation, and deception were activated.\nIf you have been following stories in recent years of scientists and researchers who make discoveries that are threatening to the Deep State and the bottom line of Big Pharma, you will have seen the pattern before.

Mikovits, following the publication of her since-retracted paper, made a series of unsupported claims that XMRV was the cause of myriad other medical maladies, including autism and cancer, and that XMRV in humans could have its origins in mouse cells used in the vaccine production process \u2014 a notion that has been exhaustively discredited.\nMuch of the material Mikovits used to make her point was also retracted, including a 2006 paper that alleged to show XMRV was present in human prostate cancer cells but actually produced erroneous results due to laboratory contamination.\nAn exhaustive body of work, which includes some of the same researchers involved in the original 2009 paper, has discredited any link between XMRV and disease. \u201cThe bottom line is we found no evidence of infection with XMRV \u2026 These results refute any correlation between these agents and disease,\u201d said co-author Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in a press release.\nTo suggest that Mikovits\u2019 arrest stemmed from a perceived threat to the vaccine industry or \u201cThe Deep State\u201d and not her alleged refusal to return scientific data and equipment to the institute that fired her requires completely ignoring this large body of scientific work while solely relying on the narrative presented by Mikovits in her 2014 book, Plague: One Scientist\u2019s Intrepid Search for the Truth about Human Retroviruses and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Autism, and Other Diseases.\nIn the introduction to that work, which entirely ignored her firing from Whittemore, Mikovits alleged that the federal government had threatened to arrest her if she set foot on National Institutes of Health property to participate in the study that attempted to validate her previous work:\nWhile I was preparing to return to Dr. Frank Rusetti\u2019s lab in Frederick, Maryland and participate in the multi-center validation study directed by Dr. Ian Lipkin, an email would be sent to Frank by none other than Dr. Tony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

We reached out to Dr. Tony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institute of Health, about the existence of the email in which he allegedly threatened Mikovits with arrest, and he told us (via email):\nI have no idea what she is talking about. I can categorically state that I have never sent such an e-mail to Dr. Ruscetti. I had my IT people here at NIH search all my e-mails and no such e-mail exists. Having said that, I would never make such a statement in an e-mail that anyone \u201cwould be immediately arrested\u201d if they stepped foot on NIH property.\nI have no idea what she is talking about.

In a video produced by the conspiracy website Natural News in 2018, however, Mikovits made a series of additional claims that she had been fired and jailed for exposing that millions of Americans had supposedly been infected with viruses \u201cthat came from out of labs into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines\u201d:\nThe fact that [these allegedly human-derived viruses] were real was just too much for 25 million Americans are infected with the viruses that came from out of labs into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines. And that was what \u2026 so I was fired, jailed without cause, without hearing, without any civil rights at all, just drug out of my house in shackles one day, November 18th 2011.\nThe fact that [these allegedly human-derived viruses] were real was just too much for 25 million Americans are infected with the viruses that came from out of labs into humans via contaminated blood and vaccines.

To say Mikovits was jailed for exposing widespread virus transmission via vaccines or blood transfusions is false, not only because she was actually jailed for allegedly stealing property, but also because she never scientifically demonstrated the claim she suggests the government wanted to silence her over. In her interview with Natural News, Mikovits stated that the idea for the connection between viruses and vaccines came from another researcher in a paper published in 2011:\nSo in 2011 another AIDS researcher in a journal called Frontiers in Microbiology wrote a paper that really cost me a lot. I didn\u2019t know he was gonna write this paper but it basically said, \u201cThe most likely way that these murine leukemia virus related viruses, these types of viruses entered humans was through vaccines.\u201d\nSo in 2011 another AIDS researcher in a journal called Frontiers in Microbiology wrote a paper that really cost me a lot.

We hypothesize that mouse cells or human cell lines used for vaccine production could have been contaminated with a replicating variant of the XMRV precursors encoded by the mouse genome.\nThat study did conclude by opining that the \u201cmost likely mode of XMRV transmission points to mouse-derived biological products\u201d and stating that the authors hoped the study would \u201cspur further discussion and help to resolve the many remaining XMRV questions.\u201d But in a paper published just five months later titled \u201cXMRV: Not a Mousy Virus\u201d, those same authors walked back claims of XMRV\u2019s prevalence (and even its existence as a true human virus) based on results which called earlier laboratory methods into question:\nXMRV was discovered in 2006 in tumor tissue from patients with prostate cancer [paper retracted] with a viral genome sequence highly similar to that of mouse xenotropic retroviruses. Sequence analysis suggested that XMRV is a novel recombinant derived from two fragmented endogenous murine viruses integrated in the mouse genome. XMRV was subsequently detected in other prostate cancer tissues and in blood from patients with CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome) [paper retracted].\nHowever, most other studies failed to replicate these findings, especially outside the USA, suggesting either that the virus has a limited geographical spread, or that positive results were due to contamination of biological reagents or human samples with mouse DNA. Four recent papers indeed show that murine DNA sequences can be detected virtually everywhere, and that extreme care should be taken when amplifying XMRV sequences. These results certainly put into serious doubt some of the high prevalence results and proposed disease associations that could not be confirmed by others.\nXMRV was discovered in 2006 in tumor tissue from patients with prostate cancer [paper retracted] with a viral genome sequence highly similar to that of mouse xenotropic retroviruses.

The virus was propagated via cell lines derived from a tumor present in this mouse and spread through contamination of laboratory samples. Well-controlled experiments showed that detection of XMRV was due to contaminated samples and was not a marker of or a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS.\nMolecular biologists traced the development of XMRV to a recombination event in a laboratory mouse that likely occurred circa 1993.

When these near-Earth objects (NEOs) are discovered, NASA monitors them to find out when they will approach Earth, how fast they will be traveling, how large they are, and how close they will get. All of this data is publicly available on the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) website.\u00a0\nAsteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) was first discovered (as its name implies) in 1998, so this asteroid isn\u2019t making a sudden and scary appearance above Earth. NASA has been monitoring it for more than two decades and has learned quite a bit. For instance, the asteroid is relatively large with a diameter between 1.1 and 2.5 miles, and it will be traveling at just under 20,000 mph when it makes its closest approach to Earth.\u00a0\nWhile an asteroid of this size\u00a0would\u00a0cause catastrophic damage if it hit Earth, there\u2019s practically no chance that will happen in April 2020. According to NASA, this asteroid won\u2019t come within 3.9 million miles of Earth. In other words, it will approach no closer than about 16 times the distance between us and the moon.\nAsteroid Watch, the official Twitter account of the CNEOS, attempted to quell fears about this asteroid, writing that it will \u201csafely pass\u201d Earth and that NASA did not issue a \u201cwarning\u201d about a possible catastrophic collision. Asteroid 52768 (1998 OR2) is not currently listed on NASA\u2019s \u00a0list of\u00a0potential future Earth impact events.\u00a0\nCNEOS writes (emphasis ours):\u00a0\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface.

The KPIX-TV article to which he linked did not contain any reference to the paint used by Argentinian artist Andr\u00e9s Pereoselli (known as \u201cCobre\u201d) in creating the Thunberg mural. As such, it did not provide any evidence to support Straka\u2019s key claim, that the portrait of the climate activist required 700 gallons of aerosol spray paint.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not clear where that figure came from, but it might have originated in an article on the right-leaning website The Blaze, which wrote:\n\u201cWhile it is unclear how many spray cans [Cobre] has used, the mural spans four stories and at least one smaller project utilized 500 cans of the paint scientists say can generate asthma-inducing smog.\u201d\nThe Daily Wire, another right-leaning website, subsequently extrapolated that \u201cthe Thunberg mural\u00a0will likely take closer to 700 cans to finish.\u201d\nIn response to concerns about the use of aerosol spray paint, One Atmosphere, a California environmental non-profit group that collaborated with Cobre on the mural, posted the following explanation to Instagram on Nov. 11:\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural. Read on for some details. The vast majority of the paint is water-based acrylic exterior paint that was rolled onto the building by hand. The finishing details can only be done with spray paint, but we are using spray cans without CFCs. (CFCs are tremendously damaging to the environment). We are using low pressure cans with a minimal footprint. The cans and the boxes will also be recycled, although many of the cans will first have a second life as part of a separate art project.\nThe cans have been picked up and delivered in an electric vehicle, and the artist and organizers have been travelling almost exclusively by way of electric car, electric scooter or on foot to the project site. The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nSome folks have been asking about the environmental impacts of the Greta mural.

The lift being used is also electric, not diesel. We are doing our best to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, in that order!\nAfter the completion of the project, One Atmosphere\u2019s Executive Director Paul Scott provided further details to Snopes in an email. He firmly rejected the claim that the project required 700 gallons, or even 700 cans, of spray paint.\nIn reality, Scott said he counted a total of 117 used 400-ml cans of spray paint, almost all of them from the MTN 94 brand. That\u2019s just over 12 gallons in total. However, only some of that 400-ml capacity is taken up by the hydrocarbon propellant that escapes into the atmosphere (as opposed to the liquid paint, which ends up on the side of the building).\u00a0\nAll aerosol spray paints use a propellant to help disperse the paint from the can and onto its intended surface. In the past, manufacturers used chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), chemicals that were widely banned from the late 1980s onwards due to the fact that they deplete the ozone layers in the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.\u00a0\nIn the United States in 2019, spray paint manufacturers use hydrocarbons such as propane and butane as propellants. Unlike CFCs, hydrocarbons don\u2019t have a deleterious effect on ozone, but they do have a small effect on global warming. However, it\u2019s worth putting the scale of that effect into some context, using a measure known as Global Warming Potential.\u00a0\nAs the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains on its website:\n\u201cThe Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period.\u201d\nThe CFCs used as propellants in aerosol paint in the past have a GWP of between 5,000 and 14,000. Propane, a hydrocarbon commonly used now as a propellant in spray paint, has a GWP of 4. In his email to Snopes, Scott added that, \u201cThe amount of the propellant is also less because the cans are lower pressure, and obviously only a portion of each can is propellant, so the ultimate GWP impact of the cans we used is very limited.\u201d\nScott told Snopes that One Atmosphere had also sought to neutralize any effects caused by the Thunberg mural through the use of carbon offsets.

For instance, the website Digital Wise rehashed this article under the title \u201cNASA Issues Warning Over Asteroid Predicted To Hit Earth Five Days Before Christmas!\u201d\nNASA has made no such announcement, and Earth is not in danger of being hit by an asteroid around Christmas.\u00a0\nThese articles are all based on a real asteroid (known as 216258 2006 WH1) and its holiday approach toward Earth. However, these articles present the information as if this asteroid is particularly dangerous. But there\u2019s nothing unusually threatening about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1.\nNASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) currently lists 26 near-Earth objects that are scheduled to pass by our planet within the next 60 days. While asteroid 216258 2006 WH1 (which was discovered in 2006) will truly be passing by earth around Christmas, CNEOS reports that the asteroid is expected to safely pass by earth at a distance of about 15.19 LD (lunar distance), approximately 3.6 million miles.\nDr. Paul W. Chodas, the Director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, told us in an email that there is \u201cnothing unusual or dangerous\u201d about asteroid 216258 2006 WH1:\nNo, there is nothing unusual or dangerous about this asteroid. It is simply making a close approach to the Earth.

In 2018, the White House released the National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan, which identifies key steps that US agencies need to take to better prepare the United States\u2014and the world\u2014for detecting and responding to a possible impact. NASA has been directed by Congress to catalogue and characterize all NEOs bigger than 140 meters, the ones that could be catastrophic.

The organization writes on its website (emphasis ours):\u00a0\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface. Most of the smallest interplanetary particles that reach the Earth\u2019s surface are the tiny dust particles that are released by comets as their ices vaporize in the solar neighborhood. The vast majority of the larger interplanetary material that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface originates as the collision fragments of asteroids that have run into one another some eons ago.\nWith an average interval of about 10,000 years, rocky or iron asteroids larger than about 100 meters would be expected to reach the Earth\u2019s surface and cause local disasters or produce the tidal waves that can inundate low lying coastal areas. On an average of every several hundred thousand years or so, asteroids larger than a kilometer could cause global disasters. In this case, the impact debris would spread throughout the Earth\u2019s atmosphere so that plant life would suffer from acid rain, partial blocking of sunlight, and from the firestorms resulting from heated impact debris raining back down upon the Earth\u2019s surface. Since their orbital paths often cross that of the Earth, collisions with near-Earth objects have occurred in the past and we should remain alert to the possibility of future close Earth approaches. It seems prudent to mount efforts to discover and study these objects, to characterize their sizes, compositions and structures and to keep an eye upon their future trajectories \u2026\n\u2026 No one should be overly concerned about an Earth impact of an asteroid or comet. The threat to any one person from auto accidents, disease, other natural disasters and a variety of other problems is much higher than the threat from NEOs. Over long periods of time, however, the chances of the Earth being impacted are not negligible so that some form of NEO insurance is warranted. At the moment, our best insurance rests with the NEO scientists and their efforts to first find these objects and then track their motions into the future. We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.\nOn a daily basis, about one hundred tons of interplanetary material drifts down to the Earth\u2019s surface.

We need to first find them, then keep an eye on them.\nNASA Near-Earth Object Observations Program is constantly monitoring the skies for approaching asteroids and meteors. So far, the program has discovered more than 19,000 NEOs. When NASA discovers an NEO, it works to determine as much information as possible about the object, such as its size, speed, and orbit, so that the agency can calculate when it will approach Earth and how close it will come when it does.\u00a0\nBut the 19,000 NEOs in NASA\u2019s database aren\u2019t really what we have to worry about. The organization writes that thousands of NEOs have yet to be discovered:\nAsteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process. Every day, 80 to 100 tons of material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids that disintegrate in Earth\u2019s atmosphere). Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth\u2019s atmosphere and created spectacular bolides (fireballs). Experts estimate that an impact of an object the size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 \u2013 approximately 55 feet (17 meters) in size \u2013 takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia). However, given the current incompleteness of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact \u2013 such as the Chelyabinsk event \u2013 could occur at any time.\nAsteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process.

Objects of this size and larger pose a risk to Earth of greatest concern due to the level of devastation an impact would cause, and should continue to be the focus of global search efforts. While no known asteroid larger than 140 meters in size has a significant chance to hit Earth for the next 100 years, less than half of the estimated 25,000 NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size have been found to date.\nThe current congressionally directed objective of the NEO Observations Program is to find, track, and characterize at least 90 percent of the predicted number of NEOs that are 140 meters and larger in size\u2013larger than a small football stadium\u2013and to characterize a subset representative of the entire population.

[\u2026] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.\nThere is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to \u201cuncover\u201d betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.\nThe \u201csmoking gun\u201d concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides \u201ca measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.\u201d\nTo argue for evidence of \u201cfaked\u201d data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:\n\n(These charts plot how far off each year\u2019s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951\u20131980; the frame labeled \u201ca\u201d is from 1999.)\nIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.\nWriting for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies\u2019 climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an \u201cunadjusted global temperature record\u201d \u2014 which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number \u2014 is not really a thing that exists to begin with:\nThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that \u2026 there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.\nNearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.\nThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

According to NASA\u2019s GISTEMP website, \u201cStarting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.\u201d The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a \u201cclimate change narrative.\u201d\nThese \u201cnon-climatic biases\u201d include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA\u2019s website. They included:\nAdditionally, post-1999 GISTEMP records employ models to fill in areas with missing data to make a more complete record from a spatial perspective. The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.\nAll told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.\nThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15\u00baC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the \u2026 record is a warming of about 0.3\u00baC\nThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15\u00baC over the 100 years.

Due to their unexplained nature, they are popular with those seeking to stoke fears or make political or religious points. In 2011, for example, Arkansas, Louisiana, and parts of Sweden were the site of thousands of bird deaths in a short time, which the media dubbed \u201cthe aflockalypse.\u201d Contemporaneous reporting by the Associated Press made it clear that these mass die-offs are quite common and often unexplained:\nSince the 1970s, the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin has tracked mass deaths among birds, fish and other critters, said wildlife disease specialist LeAnn White.

Various countries have tested forms of it, including The Netherlands, but its widespread adoption is not expected until 2020. We will discuss the technical aspects of 5G compared to existing cellular technology in the next section, but widespread access to this technology is a priority for the Dutch government, and they have performed tests of the technology a handful of times.\nOne such test did occur in an area generally near Huijgenspark, but it took place on 28 June 2018, and it was not followed by a massive bird die-off. For this test, the Dutch equivalent of the FCC provided a one-day permit for the telecommunication company Huawei to use the 5G frequencies needed for the test:\nHuawei has demonstrated a live 5G network in The Hague, using 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band at 3.5 GHz. As the frequencies are not normally available for mobile services in the Netherlands, the Telecom Agency granted a special one-day permit for the demonstration at the KPN office in the Voorburg area. The band is available for local licensing, but in allotments far smaller than the full 100 MHz width that is standardized for 5G.\nHuawei has demonstrated a live 5G network in The Hague, using 100 MHz of spectrum in the C-band at 3.5 GHz. As the frequencies are not normally available for mobile services in the Netherlands, the Telecom Agency granted a special one-day permit for the demonstration at the KPN office in the Voorburg area. The band is available for local licensing, but in allotments far smaller than the full 100 MHz width that is standardized for 5G.\nNo evidence suggests that any other 5G test ever occurred in The Hague or that a 5G antenna was installed near that park conveniently out of view. We reached out via Twitter to the Dutch company NS, the operator of the train station allegedly involved in the 5G test, and a representative told us that they were \u201cunaware that recent 5G tests were conducted at this location.\u201d A representative of KPN, the largest mobile operator in The Netherlands, told us via Twitter that \u201cI can be very clear about this matter; there are no 5G tests in Den Haag. This is a complete hoax.\u201d Huawei, the cellular provider who took part in the one-day June test, did not respond to our inquiry about a test occurring, but the Dutch equivalent to the FCC asserted that no such test occurred.\nIt bears mentioning that Kuhles has since walked back his claim that a 5G test occurred at all (though this fact does not appear to have dissuaded Erin Elizabeth from running with her story), and he has now moved the goalposts so far as to claim that perhaps it was just a whole lot of 4G LTE networks getting up in those birds\u2019 business. Either way, from a scientific standpoint his ideas would generously be described as dubious.\nPromoters of 5G technology promise faster data rates along with reduced energy and financial cost. For the most part, these improvements will come from utilizing higher frequency radio bands and the development of more advanced cellular towers:\nTypically when a new mobile wireless technology comes along (like 5G), it\u2019s assigned a higher radio frequency \u2026 The reason new wireless technologies occupy higher frequencies is because they typically aren\u2019t in use and move information at a much faster speed. The problem is that higher frequency signals don\u2019t travel as far as lower frequencies, so multiple input and output antennas (MIMOs) will probably be used to boost signals anywhere 5G is offered.\nTypically when a new mobile wireless technology comes along (like 5G), it\u2019s assigned a higher radio frequency \u2026 The reason new wireless technologies occupy higher frequencies is because they typically aren\u2019t in use and move information at a much faster speed. The problem is that higher frequency signals don\u2019t travel as far as lower frequencies, so multiple input and output antennas (MIMOs) will probably be used to boost signals anywhere 5G is offered.\nIn Europe, 5G will make use of three frequency ranges: a low-frequency 700MHz \u201ccoverage layer,\u201d a 3.4-3.8GHz band which will be the primary bandwidth, and a \u201csuper data layer\u201d in the higher frequency 24.25-27.5GHz band. This latter range is more theoretical and is not what has been tested in The Netherlands thus far, as the only known test of 5G in the Hague utilized the 3.4-3.8GHz band. Regardless, all of these frequencies fall within a range considered by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (first in 1998 and again in 2009) to be safe:\nIt is the opinion of ICNIRP that the scientific literature published since the 1998 guidelines has provided no evidence of any adverse effects below the basic restrictions and does not necessitate an immediate revision of its guidance on limiting exposure to high frequency electromagnetic fields \u2026 The plausibility of the various non-thermal mechanisms that have been proposed is very low. In addition, the recent in vitro and animal genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are rather consistent overall and indicate that such effects are unlikely at low levels of exposure. Therefore, ICNIRP reconfirms the 1998 basic restrictions in the frequency range 100 kHz\u2013300 GHz until further notice.\nIt is the opinion of ICNIRP that the scientific literature published since the 1998 guidelines has provided no evidence of any adverse effects below the basic restrictions and does not necessitate an immediate revision of its guidance on limiting exposure to high frequency electromagnetic fields \u2026 The plausibility of the various non-thermal mechanisms that have been proposed is very low.

Therefore, ICNIRP reconfirms the 1998 basic restrictions in the frequency range 100 kHz\u2013300 GHz until further notice.\nRadio waves used in cellular technology can be described both by their frequency (or wavelength) and in terms of the energy being used to carry that frequency. The aforementioned restrictions refer to limits on the energy carrying a signal, which create exposure limits for various frequencies. Dr. Eric van Rongen, a member of the Health Council of the Netherlands and the Chairman of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, told us via email that the levels of exposure in the 5G frequency range are comparable to existing technology:\nThe levels of exposure would be comparable to those of the current (3G and 4G) networks, and thus very low, much lower than the exposure limits. The only way one could imagine death of birds as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields is with very high level exposure that results in considerable heating \u2026 But the levels that are used by mobile telecom antennas are not strong enough for this to happen. There are maybe millions of such antennas around the world and this has never been reported.\nThe levels of exposure would be comparable to those of the current (3G and 4G) networks, and thus very low, much lower than the exposure limits.

Erin Elizabeth\u2019s post, which has been shared well over 125,000 times on Facebook, included all of Khule\u2019s posts on the subject up to 2 November 2018.\nBut on 8 November 2018, Kuhles posted again, appealing to his own authority while making sure everyone knew he wasn\u2019t really all that serious about that whole 5G thing in the first place. He brushed off factual criticism by calling his doubters sheeple and capitalizing certain words to make the letters LIE more prominent:\nSome think there is \u201cno 5G\u201d in Den Haag.

This journalistic \u201cscoop\u201d did not come from a whistleblower or leaked documents, Turner stated, but from a 20-year-old educational feature on NASA\u2019s publicly accessible online magazine, Earth Observatory:\nOn its Earth Observatory web site, NASA published in the year 2000, the information they possessed about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, which was PROVED to be fact by core samples from the earth\u2019s seas.\u00a0 Climate Changes \u2013 warming and destructive weather \u2013 happen naturally from changes in earth\u2019s solar orbit, and the extent of earth\u2019s axis tilt.\u00a0 NOT from man-induced factors!\nOn its Earth Observatory web site, NASA published in the year 2000, the information they possessed about the Milankovitch Climate Theory, which was PROVED to be fact by core samples from the earth\u2019s seas.\u00a0 Climate Changes \u2013 warming and destructive weather \u2013 happen naturally from changes in earth\u2019s solar orbit, and the extent of earth\u2019s axis tilt.\u00a0 NOT from man-induced factors!\nThis story was picked up by the website Natural News, where it gained further virality. One of the more telling approaches for outlets that promote a specific brand of climate-change denial is to report as news their \u201cdiscovery\u201d of something that, while perhaps new to them, is fundamental to the field of climate science and in no way in conflict with the concept of anthropogenic climate change.\nWhen climate scientists discuss evidence for anthropogenic changes in the climate system, they do not simultaneously argue that there are no natural causes of variation in the climate system. Asserting that would be a straw-man argument. Evidence of natural climate variability is not evidence of a lack of human input into the climate system. That is, however, the sole premise both the Natural News and Hal Turner posts work with, per Natural News:\nIt was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth\u2019s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as \u201cwarming\u201d (or \u201ccooling,\u201d depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.\nIt was the year 1958, to be precise, when NASA first observed that changes in the solar orbit of the earth, along with alterations to the earth\u2019s axial tilt, are both responsible for what climate scientists today have dubbed as \u201cwarming\u201d (or \u201ccooling,\u201d depending on their agenda). In no way, shape, or form are humans warming or cooling the planet by driving SUVs or eating beef, in other words.\n(As an aside, 1958 was the year NASA was founded. It holds zero specific relevance to the history of Milankovitch cycles.)\nAs accurately copied and pasted from NASA\u2019s website, Milankovich cycles do indeed describe three periodic variations in the way the Earth rotates around the sun. Eccentricity describes the shape (how circular or oblong the path is) of Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun. That shape varies over long periods of time between nearly a perfect circle and slightly oval-shaped orbit. The eccentricity cycle, from circular to oval and back to circular, lasts (in simplified terms) roughly 100,000 years.\nAnother cycle, precession, describes how the orientation of Earth\u2019s axis varies over time such that the North Pole is not always pointed at the North Star as it is today. Instead, it cycles like a slightly off-center toy top, returning to its original position every 26,000 years. The final cycle, axial tilt or obliquity, describes the angle at which Earth\u2019s axis is tilted. This angle, which is responsible for our seasons, is not fixed and ranges between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees over a cycle that lasts 41,000 years.\nKnowledge of these cycles, each of which affects aspects of the climate system in different ways, is immensely helpful to scientists \u2014 especially climate scientists. Combining the relative input of each of these cycles, scientists can mathematically determine how much solar energy any given part of the Earth\u2019s surface would have received at any time going back (or forward) in time. In geologic records of past climate, the rhythm of this cycle can be seen in intricate detail such that it can be used to figure out how much time a given rock or core sample represents. This holds up even if that rock was deposited alongside dinosaurs millions of years in the past.\nMilankovitch cycles do not complicate the scientific observation that human-released CO2 is causing an observable net increase in global temperatures. Milankovitch cycles operate on time scales that are vastly greater \u2014 tens to hundreds of thousands of years \u2014 than the timescales at issue for anthropogenic global warming.\nLeft to its own devices, the orbital arrangement our planet currently finds itself in would likely keep us in the current interglacial period (not a widespread ice age, not an ice-free world) we currently find ourselves in for another 50,000 years \u2014 a relatively quiet period of time from a Milankovich perspective. In other words, Milankovitch cycles cannot address rapid rises in temperatures that are currently being witnessed on human time scales \u2014 events occurring on time periods that represent a fraction of even the shortest Milankovitch cycle. The concern is what added effect humans are putting into the system on top of the more slowly varying orbital changes.\nThe assertion that NASA is \u201cadmitting\u201d anything by acknowledging the not-at-all controversial existence of Milankovitch cycles is false, and a full article alleging as such betrays nothing but an ignorance of the field such outlets claim to be exposing."}, "20": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sniffing-rosemary/", "title": "\tDoes Sniffing Rosemary Increase Memory by 75 Percent?", "subtitle": "\t\tSuch quantitative sounding claims are great for viral shares and page views but are meaningless when one digs into their origins.  \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["11 February 2019"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/10/Human_brain_01.jpg?resize=800%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tSniffing rosemary increases human memory by up to 75 percent.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nRosemary has long been associated with memory enhancement in classical literature and in folklore.

Dr Mark Moss, who will present the findings today at the British Psychology Society conference in Harrogate, said the benefit of aromas was becoming clear through scientific investigation \u2026\nRosemary essential oil was diffused in to a testing room by placing four drops on an aroma stream fan diffuser and switching this on five minutes before people entered the room. Altogether 66 people took part in the study and were randomly allocated to either the rosemary-scented room or another room with no scent. In each room participants completed a test designed to assess their prospective memory functions \u2026\nResearcher Jemma McCready said \u2018The difference between the two groups was 60-75 per cent, for example one group would remember to do seven things compared with four tasks completed by those who did not smell the oil, and they were quicker.\n\n\nA team of psychologists at Northumbria University, Newcastle, tested the effects of essential oils from rosemary.

In that press release \u2014 and in all the other non-Daily Mail coverage generated by news outlets taking quotes from that press release \u2014 researcher Jemma McCready did not make the statement about \u201cthe difference between the two groups was 60-75 per cent\u201d in print. Unless she made that statement specifically to the Daily Mail, we cannot ascertain its source or its larger context. (We attempted to reach out to McCready to ask if she offered any formulation of this statement to the Daily Mail, but we were unable to reach her.)\nEven if McCready did make this statement, however, it needs to be taken for what it is: an extremely reductive distillation of information that sounds good in a headline but means very little scientifically. It appears to stem solely from the observation that people in the aroma group \u2014 \u201cfor example\u201d \u2014 \u201cwould remember to do seven things\u201d while people in the other group only completed four tasks, and seven, mathematically speaking, is 75% more than four. The referenced tasks are part of a battery of tests used for memory research, and typically include challenges such as word recall, putting things in order, etc.\nWe asked Moss, the professor in whose lab the experiment was conducted, if it would be fair to rate such results as a \u201c75% increase in memory,\u201d and he responded via email that \u201cI think [Daily Mail] missed a decimal point! 7.5% would be nearer the mark!\u201d \nA large part of Moss\u2019 research, including the study at issue here, focuses on the chemical 1,8-cineole, which is a fragrant component of rosemary that, as Moss and colleagues found, can pass into the human bloodstream when sniffed, providing a potential chemical mechanism underlying rosemary\u2019s memory effects.\nThough research in this area remains active, many scientists have been moving away from the notion that specific chemical components in rosemary oil (or other essential oils) can affect memory directly. Rachel Hertz, a professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at the Brown University Medical School, who has authored several detailed reviews of the scientific basis for aromatherapy, told us via email that there is nothing special about rosemary or any other scent regarding memory, unless that memory is previously associated with a smell, in which case the aroma can serve as a \u201cretrieval cue\u201d:\n\u201cRosemary can not in and of itself increase memory and the field has changed [away from that view]. Rosemary would be no better than any other scent to which an association to certain memories had been linked. However, if rosemary were linked to remembering certain information it would work as an effective retrieval cue.\u201d\nRegardless of these debates, however, no robust scientific study has demonstrated that sniffing rosemary increases a human being\u2019s memory by 75%."}, "21": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dangers-dihydrogen-monoxide/", "title": "\tIs Dihydrogen Monoxide Dangerous?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe dihydrogen monoxide hoax shows that even the most innocuous of substances can be made to sound like a dangerous threat to human life.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Mikkelson\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["22 June 1999", "6 February 2019"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2015/03/water-faucet-dihydrogen-monoxide.jpg", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tDihydrogen monoxide is a dangerous chemical that should be banned.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn April Fool\u2019s Day in 2013, a pair of Florida disc jockeys got themselves into a bit of hot water with station management for prankishly warning their listeners that \u201cdihydrogen monoxide\u201d \u2014 another name for that life-giving substance we identify as H2O, or more commonly, \u201cwater\u201d \u2014 was coming out of local residents\u2019 taps:\n\nThe radio station\u2019s joke involved that \u201cdihydrogen monoxide\u201d was coming out of county residents\u2019 taps.The joke immediately got the attention of Patty DiPiero from Lee County Utilities.

One example, presented as several news outlets reported on the potential for rain to develop in the still smoldering regions affected by the Camp Fire, was that the rain in these smoky regions would \u201cclean out\u201d the air but result in toxic rainfall:\n\nSuch warnings made a specific assumption: Water that falls as precipitation in smoky areas develops toxicity prior to its hitting the ground. This is clear both in the post\u2019s explicit statement that the rain will be \u201cextremely toxic,\u201d and in the implicit assumptions inherent in the post\u2019s tips for potentially avoiding that danger. The text refers to danger to pets during the storm, for example, and suggests the water that falls on your clothing (presumably from precipitation) requires a change of garb.\nHow this danger would present itself, although not actually described in the post, could conceivably be explained by one of two mechanisms. First, it could be that toxin-containing particulate matter in the smoke will necessarily become contained within the raindrops that fall to the ground, on your clothing, or on your pet. A second possibility is that people have conflated rain following a wildfire with acid rain, which forms in the presence of sulfuric (and to a lesser degree nitric) gases released from burning fossil fuels. Either of these mechanisms as an explanation for how rain following a wildfire could be dangerous is lacking, however.\nAcid rain is principally caused  by the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2) from burning fossil fuels, which becomes sulfuric acid that is incorporated into rainfall. Fossil fuels (i.e., rocks, gases, and oils derived from material that was once living but has been converted into a mess of flammable carbon-based compounds over millions of years) are naturally likely to contain sulfur compounds. Though fossil fuels are generally produced from the sulfur-free carbon of microscopic organisms, the conditions such material is exposed to over time often introduces sulfur into the chemical matrix. It is this sulfur that is most responsible for acid rain.\nWildfires, on the other hand, involve the burning of currently (or recently) living carbon products such as trees and brush, which have not undergone any processes that would incorporate large quantities of sulfur into them. Therefore, the gas emitted by wildfires is dominated by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide with little to no sulfur dioxide. These escaping gases do not serve to acidify the rain in any meaningful way.\nNo doubt the smoke from wildfires, especially those that burn through residential areas (as in the case of the Camp Fire), contains myriad dangerous toxic chemicals that can harm human health. Indeed, smoke has the potential to contain a cornucopia of toxins:\nSmoke can contain thousands of individual compounds, in categories such as [particulate matter], hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, trace minerals, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor \u2026 The health effects widely considered to be linked with wildfire smoke include exacerbation of preexisting respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reduced lung function, chest pain, and general symptoms such as eye irritation, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and stress.\nSmoke can contain thousands of individual compounds, in categories such as [particulate matter], hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, trace minerals, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water vapor \u2026 The health effects widely considered to be linked with wildfire smoke include exacerbation of preexisting respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), reduced lung function, chest pain, and general symptoms such as eye irritation, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and stress.\nThis is one of the reasons why the air quality index in regions downwind of the Camp Fire (and others) is so poor, and why people have been warned to stay inside or wear masks. If, however, the fear is that these materials will get incorporated into the rain, then that explanation is unworkable, and the reason is simple: that particulate matter is no longer there. Instead, the most dangerous particulate matter produced by the Camp Fire has been diluted and dispersed across a massive stretch of land to the south.\nWe reached out to the California Department of Water Resources to ask about the claims made of toxic rain following wildfires, and our query was forwarded to the California Air Resource Board. There, a spokesperson told us via email that the toxic rain claims were dubious due to the migration of particulate matter after the fire: \u201cEmission from homes and other structures that burned already dispersed with the prevailing winds last week. The smoke we are seeing now comes from vegetative matter still burning.\u201d\nThe California Air Resource Board also told us it was unlikely that particulate matter could become incorporated into California rain even if it existed in high concentrations in the area of the fire: \u201cLarge-scale weather systems (like the one California expected and received late last week), tend to dilute wildfire smoke to a point where it becomes nontoxic to human health.\u201d\nFor those two reasons, it is unlikely the rain that falls in \u201csmoke affected areas\u201d contains much in the way of dangerous particulate material, toxic or otherwise.\nSome confusion regarding the danger posed by rain following wildfires can potentially be linked to the real potential for toxic effects to water bodies in fire-burned regions. Wildfires can affect the health of aqueous ecosystems, although not via a process that involves the transportation of toxins through raindrops. Instead, the mechanism would be from the increased runoff of sediment and ground chemicals into water bodies as a result of the loss of roots and vegetation:\nWildfires can affect the physical, chemical, and biological quality of streams, rivers, and lakes. After a fire, increased runoff provides the pathway for the transport of chemical-laden sediment to surface water, which may have substantial water quality impacts.\nWildfires can affect the physical, chemical, and biological quality of streams, rivers, and lakes. After a fire, increased runoff provides the pathway for the transport of chemical-laden sediment to surface water, which may have substantial water quality impacts.\nOne primary water quality concern after a wildfire is nutrient loading. Burning vegetation frees up substantial amounts of key nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which can lead to massive algal blooms that deprive water of its oxygen \u2014 killing animals while producing toxins:\nBurning vegetation releases nutrients contained within plants including nitrate, ammonia and phosphate. At high concentrations, ammonia can be toxic to fish and other aquatic life. Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially nitrate, can be a concern if downstream uses include a public drinking water supply. Increases in nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations also may lead to algal blooms resulting in extreme daily fluctuations in oxygen or oxygen depletion as plant photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition intensify. Anaerobic conditions (i.e., lack of oxygen) stress aquatic organisms and can alter a wide range of chemical equilibria, which may mobilize certain toxic pollutants.\nBurning vegetation releases nutrients contained within plants including nitrate, ammonia and phosphate.

The dangerous effects would begin only after the water had fallen on the ground.\nRain following wildfires poses unique risks to burned areas. Most significantly, the lack of vegetation makes catastrophic mudslides much more likely. While firefighters working the Camp Fire were looking forward to the fire-fighting potential of rains later in the week, they were also wary of the effect the precipitation will have on search and rescue efforts:\nHundreds of searchers continued looking for human remains in the ashes in Paradise and outlying areas ravaged by the blaze Nov. 8, with the body count increasing daily. Rain in [the] forecast added urgency to the task: While it could help knock down the flames, it could hinder the search by washing away fragmentary remains and turning ash into a thick paste.\nHundreds of searchers continued looking for human remains in the ashes in Paradise and outlying areas ravaged by the blaze Nov. 8, with the body count increasing daily.

First, it states that the USGS has \u201cincreased\u201d the \u201cthreat level\u201d of the Yellowstone Caldera in their latest report, which is not true. Second, by not fully explicating what the USGS\u2019 \u201cthreat assessment\u201d ratings mean, it suggests that the rating relates (solely) to the likelihood of an eruptive event, which is also not true.\nIn 2005, the USGS released a report titled \u201cAn Assessment of Volcanic Threat and Monitoring Capabilities in the United States: Framework for a National Volcano Early Warning System\u201d which aimed at to ensure that \u201cthe most threatening volcanoes in the United States are properly monitored in advance of the onset of unrest and at levels commensurate with the threats posed.\u201d Work published in 2007 also contributed to this ranking system. Volcanic threat, as defined by the USGS, was quantified by calculating both the nature of the potential eruptive hazards as well as the potential size or extent of the human exposure to those hazards.\nIn 2005 and 2007, the Yellowstone Caldera was listed by the USGS as being a part of the \u201chigh threat\u201d category, a fact owed partially to \u201chigh visitor density\u201d of the national park that sits above it. In 2018, the Yellowstone caldera also fell into the \u201chigh risk\u201d category, so it is unclear where viral reports have gotten the notion that the threat level \u201cincreased\u201d in the latest report, because from a factual standpoint the category level has not moved.\nDisclose and other viral stories typically do not adequately define what the threat assessment means, leading several clickbait factories or social media shares to present the claim as if it were somehow a forecast for the likelihood of an eruption. The authors of the 2018 study attempted to make clear that this was not in any way the intent or nature of their report:\nThe updated national volcanic threat assessment presented here is not a forecast or indication of which volcanoes are most likely to erupt next.

Over the course of a few sentences, that website strung together multiple previously debunked Yellowstone claims into a meta-claim in need of a fresh debunking:\n\nAfter initially denying that the unusual amount of seismic activity witnessed last year was an indication of imminent danger, NASA scientists are proposing a solution that could save half the world while admitting that their intervention could initiate the explosion it was intended to prevent.\nLast year, increased seismic activity at Yellowstone generated a great deal of concern.

As we noted in our  debunking of those claims, thousands of detectable earthquakes occur in the Yellowstone region in any given year, and they in no way portend an imminent supereruption.\nThe reference to a \u201c100 ft.-wide fissure open[ing] up\u201d in nearby Grand Teton National park, as we reported in July 2018, refers to an unrelated crack in a cliff face which rangers feared could result in a large chunk of rock\u2019s crushing climbers and onlookers below, not a coming eruption. This newer iteration of a Yellowstone claim introduced viral fear by asserting that a NASA study published in 2015 (which received attention in a 2017 BBC Futures article) somehow proved NASA was not being honest about geologic events that post-dated their report.\nThat BBC Future article, which Breaking Israel News and other sources cite extensively but without context, presented commentary from an engineer at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Brian Wilcox, who served on a NASA Advisory Council on Planetary Defense. That body did conclude in 2015 that a risk of a supervolcano was more likely than a large scale comet or asteroid impact, and they gamed out a variety of extremely theoretical and long-term solutions to mitigate such a risk:\n\nSupervolcanic eruptions occur more frequently than large asteroid or comet impacts that would have a similarly catastrophic effect to human civilization, especially now that many asteroid orbits have been mapped. We assess whether future supervolcanic eruptions could be dampened, delayed, or prevented by engineering solutions.\n\n\nSupervolcanic eruptions occur more frequently than large asteroid or comet impacts that would have a similarly catastrophic effect to human civilization, especially now that many asteroid orbits have been mapped. We assess whether future supervolcanic eruptions could be dampened, delayed, or prevented by engineering solutions.\n\nThat brainstorming did not mean, however, that Wilcox or the other researchers concluded that a supereruption was more likely to occur in our lifetimes than previously thought, or that an urgent need existed to begin geoengineering solutions for it. Via email, Wilcox told us that \u201cNeither I nor, to my knowledge, any of the co-authors has commented on the seismic activity or possible danger of a near-term eruption.\u201d He referred to the geoengineering plans as a thought experiment revolving around the question \u201cis it possible for human civilization to prevent supervolcano eruptions that might threaten humanity?\u201d\nAs described by BBC Future, the solution they proposed involved utilizing the heat from the magma for geothermal energy by drilling toward the hot earth and running water through the holes. This would have two benefits, the study argued: First, in the short term, it would provide a possible source of geothermal energy; and second, in the long term, it could (over thousands of years) reduce the overall risk of a caldera-level eruption:\n\nThey believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 10km down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure. The circulating water would return at a temperature of around 662F, thus slowly day by day extracting heat from the volcano \u2026 \u201cYellowstone currently leaks around 6GW in heat,\u201d Wilcox says. \u201cThrough drilling in this way, it could be used to create a geothermal plant, which generates electric power at extremely competitive prices of around $0.10/kWh.\nYou would have to give the geothermal companies incentives to drill somewhat deeper and use hotter water than they usually would, but you would pay back your initial investment, and get electricity which can power the surrounding area for a period of potentially tens of thousands of years. And the long-term benefit is that you prevent a future supervolcano eruption which would devastate humanity.\u201d\n\n\nThey believe the most viable solution could be to drill up to 10km down into the supervolcano, and pump down water at high pressure.

In the study, the team made it clear they were speaking in terms of tens of thousands of years:\n\nThe cooling perimeter would close-in on the magma chamber at the rate of approx. 1 m/year. Even for a massive supervolcano such as Yellowstone, it would take less than 50,000 years for such a cooling system to completely drain the heat away from the magma chamber, all the while generating electricity at competitive prices.\n\n\nThe cooling perimeter would close-in on the magma chamber at the rate of approx. 1 m/year.

The link to the Rothschild family, a frequent target of conspiracy theorists and generally deployed as an anti-semitic dog whistle, is that the owner of the PGV since 2004\u00a0is a company whose founder was awarded the \u201cRothschild Prize for Innovation\u201d \u2014 in 1977.)\nThe claims laid out by YourNewsWire and Exopolitics suffer from several factual, scientific, and logical flaws, but chief among them is the fact that fracking \u2014 a process utilized by oil companies searching for fossil fuels \u2014 does not occur anywhere on Hawaii, as there are no petroleum reserves for which to frack.\nTo get around this, Exopolitics claims that the processes employed at PGV are in essence\u00a0identical to fracking, because the geothermal plant operates in a fashion that requires re-injecting a liquid into the ground. Hawaiian Electric, which had purchased energy from the plant prior to its current closure, described the process:\n\nPGV is a geothermal energy conversion plant bringing steam and hot liquid up through underground wells.\u00a0 The hot liquid (brine) is not used for electricity at this time.\u00a0 The steam is directed to a turbine generator that produces electricity.\nThe exhaust steam from this turbine is used to vaporize (heat) an organic working fluid, which drives a second turbine, generating additional electricity. The condensed steam from the organic fluid heat exchanger is re-injected into the ground through reinjection wells along with the brine.\n\nPGV is a geothermal energy conversion plant bringing steam and hot liquid up through underground wells.\u00a0 The hot liquid (brine) is not used for electricity at this time.\u00a0 The steam is directed to a turbine generator that produces electricity.\nThe exhaust steam from this turbine is used to vaporize (heat) an organic working fluid, which drives a second turbine, generating additional electricity. The condensed steam from the organic fluid heat exchanger is re-injected into the ground through reinjection wells along with the brine.\nThe primary goal of this reinjection is to stabilize the land from which the water is being extracted. Without the reinjection of water (and the only fluid in this case is water), the reservoir below would dry up, making the geology susceptible to faulting or sinkholes. The primary goal of hydraulic fracturing is to destabilize the rock below and create faults by injecting fluids (many of them organic compounds) at an extremely high pressure. The two processes are simply not comparable save for the fact that they both employ fluids and the word \u201cinject.\u201d\nExopolitics further muddles its terminology when it cites an environmental group in Hawaii opposed to a type of geothermal energy known as enhanced geothermal energy, a process that could at least in theory\u00a0involve the pressurized injection of water into the ground to alter the rocks below. The goal of enhanced geothermal energy is to create wells deep enough that they reach some area of hot geologic activity. Water is then actively pumped to depth, where it steams up from the heat of the Earth and returns to the surface as steam to create energy.\nPGV does not employ geothermal fracking \u2014 the plant was designed before the technology existed, and regardless there would be be literally no need for it. The location of PGV, next to a fault on a continuously erupting ocean island with porous volcanic ground, has all of the rare characteristics that normally make geothermal energy hard to come by.\nA summary of the potential utility of geothermal fracking published in the MIT Technology Review described these conditions as a way to explain the necessity of the emerging technology. It could also serve as a explanation for why PGV is in the location that it is in:\n\nThe main problem is that conventional geothermal plants rely on a rare combination of geological features. Hot rock has to be accompanied by large amounts of hot water or steam that can easily be pumped to the surface, where it would drive steam turbines to generate electricity. The rock formation needs to be porous enough that the water can be continuously recirculated and reheated to keep a power plant running.\n\nThe main problem is that conventional geothermal plants rely on a rare combination of geological features. Hot rock has to be accompanied by large amounts of hot water or steam that can easily be pumped to the surface, where it would drive steam turbines to generate electricity. The rock formation needs to be porous enough that the water can be continuously recirculated and reheated to keep a power plant running.\nAside from the fact that nothing that could factually be described as fracking actually occurs on Hawaii\u2019s Big Island, the evidence presented that the lower Puna lava flows were triggered by the PGV\u2019s \u201cfracking\u201d are a textbook cases of circular reasoning. Exopolitics basically attempts to make this three-part argument:\nTo Exopoltics.org\u2019s credit, it is true that fracking (if it were occurring, which it is not) could cause earthquakes. Unfortunately for their argument, another thing that causes earthquakes is volcanic activity \u2014 the very same activity that Exopolitics is trying to blame on PGV. You can\u2019t use the symptom of a lava flow (earthquakes) as as evidence that earthquakes (from fracking) caused that lava flow. That\u2019s not how this works.\nAre there earthquakes in the area of PGV? Certainly. There are earthquakes all over the volcanically active Big Island. Is it shocking that there would be earthquakes focused in the (extremely general) region of PGV? Not at all \u2014 recall that PGV\u2019s location was selected due to its proximity to a major fault system, thereby allowing water to flow through the ground and come in contact with the volcanically heated region below.\nYou cannot use PGV\u2019s location (intentionally placed in an area where earthquakes are common and lava flows likely) as evidence that it caused earthquakes and lava flows. That\u2019s not how this works. For these reasons (and so, so many more), claims that credible scientific evidence links Hawaii\u2019s 2018 lower Puna eruption to fracking \u2014 a practice that is not, even by any tangentially related definition, occurring on Hawaii\u2019s big island \u2014 are false."}, "30": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/zimbabwe-electric-car-no-charging/", "title": "\tDid a Man from Zimbabwe Invent an Electric Car That Requires No Charging?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe Internet is full of dubious claims regarding a genius Zimbabwean inventor, but nobody has ever actually seen his technology work.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["31 May 2018", "1 June 2018"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/05/electric_car_charging.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA Zimbabwean inventor named Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso invented an electric car that requires no charging.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nSince 2015, a Zimbabwean man named\u00a0Sangulani Maxwell Chikumbutso has been hailed by some on the internet as iconoclastic genius and self-taught inventor who successfully created an electric car that runs perpetually without ever needing a charge.\nAs outlandish and self-evidently incorrect as that assertion is, the journey to the source of that rumor is a fascinating mystery that began with an unsolicited invitation to a media event for a then-unknown company and provides insight into how the viral sausage is made.\nThe Saith Technologies \u201cOpen Day\u201d Event\nOn 20 July 2015, Zimbabwean tech news site Techzim began reporting on a company named Saith Technologies.

All photographic evidence used to support the existence of Chikumbutso\u2019s inventions stem from an evidently choreographed event held over the course of one day in 2015, and the website for Saith Technologies is populated with photos only from that one day. The most important (and dubious) claim relates to what he has dubbed the \u201cGreener Power Machine,\u201d or GPM, described on Saith\u2019s site:\n\nMaxwell Sangulani has always claimed the he would try to advance the ability to produce electricity by utilizing radio frequency, and this has been a proven fact.

The same power generation in the Greener generator is the one that is deployed in their Electric Vehicle.\nThe car does not require recharging from an electricity source. It requires just 5 regular gel batteries to start generating enough capacity to power the car and recharge the batteries (perpetual vehicle). Scientifically, perpetual motion says that once an object starts moving unless hindered by an external force, it will continue to move forever.\n\n[Chikumbutso] imported the shell and went through the process, with artisans, of manufacturing the chassis and mounting the \u201cengine\u201d.

The concept with these devices is that they they convert ambient radio waves, the result of humanity\u2019s love affair with technology, that bounce around our planet into enough energy to power extremely low energy devices like smoke detectors or fitness monitors. A 30 September 2015 story from the\u00a0Telegraph about a company named Freevolt describes the basic idea:\n\n\u201cIt is the nature of broadcast transmissions that, when you broadcast, only some of the energy is received and used. The energy that is not received goes to waste. It\u2019s only nanowatts of energy, but the energy is everywhere,\u201d said [Paul Drayson, CEO of the company that owns the patent].\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is using that fact to power very small low-energy devices. The radio frequency transmissions come from wireless networks, and as our hunger for information goes up, the amount of data that we want to transmit is going up exponentially, and therefore this is growing all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the nature of broadcast transmissions that, when you broadcast, only some of the energy is received and used.

Chikumbutso has repeatedly stated that he has been unable to patent his device since perpetual motion machines (which would violate the first and second laws of thermodynamics) are unpatentable.\u00a0\nTechzim ceased reporting on Saith Technologies after filing their 24 July 2015 report, evidently unconvinced that the company had much to offer.

Cryptically, a 28 September 2016 Facebook post on an account owned by de Almeida makes only one passing reference to Saith Technology\u2019s alleged work in California:\n\nToday is a blessed day, in early November we will launch our Eletric [sic] car in California, the only Eletric [sic] car that doesn\u2019t need to be recharged.\n\nToday is a blessed day, in early November we will launch our Eletric [sic] car in California, the only Eletric [sic] car that doesn\u2019t need to be recharged.\nThe Bongani Trading website that lists Caupenela and de Almeida as executives has not been updated since 2014, and includes several unfinished pages meant to be templates for news stories, suggesting that perhaps the site may not be as official as it appears, or, alternately, that their purported investment yielded no actual news.\nIt is also worth noting that 263chat\u2019s website has a disclaimer making it clear that truth is not necessarily the goal of their work: \u201cwe make no representations [\u2026] of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability or availability with respect to the website or the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose,\u201d the page reads.\nRegardless, the story originally published on 263Chat has been cloned repeatedly by countless other extremely dubious web sites, including the Zambian Observer \u2014 a site that has trafficked in fake news in the past and which may have no actual connection to the country of Zambia.\nAll of these stories rely on the claims and photographs made during one July 2015 \u201copen day\u201d event. Despite being published two years later, these accounts offer no new evidence of Chikumbutso\u2019s claims and contain no new information that could be used to verify said claims.\nThe 2018 Revival of Maxwell Chikumbutso\nOn 25 April 2018, the conspiracy oriented, reality-adjacent website Collective Evolution picked up the story once again, this time citing the aforementioned Zambian Observer story and the 2015 video of that same event from South African television. As is often the case with Collective Evolution articles, the claims made there have been cloned and regurgitated ad infinitum by other dubious clickbait sites.\nDespite now being years removed from the only demonstration of this alleged technology, their article (like all the rest) presents no new information that provides any reason to take Chikumbutso\u2019s claims \u2014 which, again, violate the fundamental laws of physics \u2014 seriously. Instead, Collective Evolution argued that Chikumbutso may be at risk now that the United States government is \u201cinvolved,\u201d although how it is involved it does not say:\n\nRight now, he is residing in California. Why did they do this? Was it because they came across a revolutionary with the power to change the world, or is it because they want to keep that which threatens their entire geo-political framework close to home so they can keep an eye on it, and control it? Who knows. But it\u2019s always important to question the intentions of our government.\n\nRight now, he is residing in California. Why did they do this?

It\u2019s possible, and the Saith Technologies website does have a donation section. Perhaps later web sites realized that this self-made genius story was clickbait gold and continued running with it for that reason.\nIt\u2019s also entirely possible that investors, and perhaps even Chikumbutso himself, fully believed in the technology they attempted to demonstrate in June 2015 \u2014 but the fact that no more demonstrations have occurred makes it clear something was, or is, off. It strains credulity to think that a car that runs indefinitely without recharging or fuel would not receive widespread financial support. We have attempted to contact Saith Technologies, but have not yet received a response.\nIn our view, however, the burden of proof for upending the first and second laws of thermodynamics lies squarely on the person making that claim. No proof has been offered in the three years since the claim was first made, and as such we confidently rate the claim that he invented a car that \u201cnever needs charging\u201d as false."}, "31": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/do-rocks-contribute-sea-rise/", "title": "\tDo Rocks Falling Into the Ocean Contribute to Global Sea Level Rise?", "subtitle": "\t\tOn human timescales, sediment and rocks flowing into the ocean do not appreciably contribute to observed sea level rise; on larger timescales, the question is irrelevant.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["18 May 2018", "21 May 2018"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2018/05/falling_rocks_sign.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\t\"Rocks falling into the ocean\" is a factor that contributes to observable sea level rise on human time scales.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 16 May 2018, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing ostensibly to discuss the ways in which \u201ctechnology could be deployed for climate change adaptation.\u201d As this committee\u2019s hearings are wont to do, however, some committee members used their time to interrogate the expert witness about the veracity of basics of climate science.\nIn this case, that witness was Philip Duffy, the president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. The most infamous exchange occurred between Duffy and Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama. Philip Bump at the Washington Post described it in a gripping play-by-play:\nBrooks asked Duffy what else might be contributing [to observed sea-level rise besides expanding oceans and melting ice]. Duffy pointed to ground subsidence, which is the sinking of the ground in places that can exacerbate the problem of rising sea levels. [\u2026] \u201cThose are all that I know of,\u201d Duffy replied.\n\u201cWhat about erosion!\u201d Brooks exclaimed. \u201cEvery single year that we\u2019re on Earth, you have huge tons of silt deposited by the Mississippi River, by the Amazon River, by the Nile, by every major river system \u2014 and for that matter, creek, all the way down to the smallest systems. And every time you have that soil or rock whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise.\nBecause now you\u2019ve got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up. [\u2026] What about the white cliffs of Dover?\u201d Brooks continued. \u201cCalifornia, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines and time and time again you have the cliffs crash into the sea.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration:\nIt is estimated that the rivers and streams flowing from the United States alone discharge 225 million tons of dissolved solids and 513 million tons of suspended sediment annually to the ocean. Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated four billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually.\nIt is estimated that the rivers and streams flowing from the United States alone discharge 225 million tons of dissolved solids and 513 million tons of suspended sediment annually to the ocean. Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated four billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually.\nThough his question makes sense from an elementary physics standpoint, Brooks is inaccurate in suggesting that this contributes in any meaningful way to the sea level rise attributed to anthropogenic global warming. Certainly, when you put something into water, that water is displaced and the water rises relative to the volume of that object \u2014 we can thank Archimedes for that one. On human timescales, however, the amount of water displaced by this sediment flow is essentially undetectable.\nWe asked Phil Woodworth, the former director of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), an international organization that maintains tide gauge records worldwide, about Brooks\u2019 question. He told us, \u201cAs large as these river transports of sediments are, the ocean volume is so enormous that they don\u2019t result in a significant change in global-average sea level.\u201d\nAccording to the IPCC\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report, which is a consensus statement produced with the input of thousands of international scientists and overseen by the United Nations, sea levels overall since 1900 have gone up on average 1.7 millimeters per year with an uncertainty of 0.2 millimeters in either direction. (Satellite data from 1993 onward indicate that this rate has been accelerating in recent years and is now thought to be around 3.3 millimeters per year).\nThat IPCC report also estimated that the annual contribution of sea level rise caused by sediment dumped into ocean basins is about 0.01 millimeters per year \u2014 a meaningless number compared to the uncertainty associated with historical sea level data. The Post, using the 3.3 millimeter per year rate estimate relevant to more recent sea level rise, described how much material would need to be carried into the ocean every year:\nSo to make the oceans rise 3.3 millimeters, we would need to displace that 1.2 trillion cubic meters of water upward by dropping in 1.2 trillion cubic meters of dirt or stone or whatever. How much is that? It\u2019s a sphere of earth a bit over 8 miles in diameter. [\u2026] If the sphere were stone, it would weigh about 6.6 quadrillion pounds. Just drop that in the ocean and \u2014 bloop! \u2014 3.3 millimeters of sea-level increase [\u2026].\nPut another way, it\u2019s a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States\u2019 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world\u2019s oceans [every year]. That would push sea levels up by 3.3 millimeters [annually].\nSo to make the oceans rise 3.3 millimeters, we would need to displace that 1.2 trillion cubic meters of water upward by dropping in 1.2 trillion cubic meters of dirt or stone or whatever.

That would push sea levels up by 3.3 millimeters [annually].\nOf course, on geologic time scales (tens of millions of years) such an amount material added to the oceans would, in theory, become meaningful. That would be true if not for the fact that \u2014 also on geologic time scales \u2014 the ocean floor actively recycles old seafloor at rates comparable to the mass added by sediment each year. On these timescales the major factors driving global sea level variability are much larger-scale processes like the subduction of continents, the rise and fall of ocean ridges, and the volcanic processes that create new rocks.\nTim Herbert,\u00a0a professor of oceanography at Brown University, told us that Brooks\u2019 argument \u2014 if looked at on these timescales \u2014 is akin to focusing on one side of a cyclic process while ignoring the processes that go the other direction. On relevant timescales, Herbert told us, the most important point is that current rate of sea level rise is substantially higher than what geologists believe to be a normal background rate:\n[There is] very clear evidence that for thousands of years in the Holocene, sea level rose very modestly. Sea level began to rise at a much steeper rate ~1850 (time of the first measurable sea level response to the input of CO2 that began with the Industrial revolution) and then has been steeply rising over the past few decades in parallel with the steep rise in CO2 and global temperatures. Every good study I know shows that current rates of sea level rise are 3-4 times the natural background rate.\n[There is] very clear evidence that for thousands of years in the Holocene, sea level rose very modestly.

The researcher behind a groundbreaking study that attempted to date the ages of various cells in a human body, Jonas Frisen, famously estimated that the average age of a cell in the human body is between 7 and 10 years old in a pivotal 2005 paper published in Cell.\nThese statements have led some to the conclusion that every cell in the human body is replaced every 7 to 10 years \u2014 a fun but inaccurate factoid commonly held as true.

The lining of the stomach, constantly under assault by digestive acid, is renewed every few days. But bones are refreshed once a decade. And there are a few parts of you that stay with you from birth to death.\nUsing a method that allowed for radiocarbon analysis of individual types of cells, Frisen and his colleagues quantified the age of intestinal cells, skeletal muscle cells, and the gray matter of two brain regions \u2014 the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. Compiling data from multiple individuals, they found:\nAs NPR also noted, some other cells will also remain with you literally from embryo to death. The cells that make up the central core of the lens of an eye remain with a human from their genesis during embryonic development to their demise at death.\nBecause of these outliers, there will never be a period of time over which one can accurately say that all of the cells in your body have been replaced by new ones (even if a vast majority of them will have been replaced in that time period).

Liquid iron or steel (the iron-based metal most commonly used to make nails) would be molten red if it were in liquid form, not bright silver as in the video, for one thing. In addition to the immutable laws of physical chemistry, claims that this rock is dissolving a typical nail are dubious, as well, because the video is showing a fairly obvious science parlor trick.\nThe metal used here is almost certainly gallium, which is solid at room temperature, but melts at around 85.6\u00baF (29.8\u00baC). A black stone sitting in the sun could easily reach this temperature and cause the gallium to liquify. Further, making gallium nails is both easy to do, and something for which there are directions on the internet. This YouTube video, for example, shows an experiment in which a person creates a gallium nail and hammers it into a piece of wood\u00a0\u2014 before melting the nail away with a hair dryer.\nThe conclusion that the Facebook video shows a gallium nail dissolving is further supported by the fact that the person handling the nail in the viral video is using a latex glove \u2014 a protective measure both because the heat of someone\u2019s hand would melt the gallium fairly quickly, and because gallium, while generally safe, can\u00a0irritate the skin upon contact.\nFor these reasons we rank the claim that the video shows a traditional nail being melted or dissolved by a rock as false.

The pursuit of truth requires humility, so I therefore must admit, although the argument is on the right track, the author misses much of the bigger picture. Common Core is not solely responsible for America\u2019s less-than-stellar educational performance. Common Core is more like a placebo fighting a long ignored infection. But while placebos have often worked to bring therapeutic relief to people, Common Core has not accomplished what is necessary to repair public education. What ails our system is mainly due to progressive education, and the cure requires more than a placebo.\nIf one is looking for a simple answer to why Common Core is bad, then my opinion is this: CC is bad because it favors teaching skills over knowledge, and it helps perpetuate the decline of Western Civilization mainly through the sidelining of quality literature and history instruction \u2026\nIf we are in want of educational reform, then we must see the faults of education for what they truly are. Common Core does harm education in many ways, but it is not the root cause. Progressive education is the root cause, and the problems stemming from it have compounded in countless ways throughout far too many schoolhouses across the country, both public and private.

Adam Rosenblatt, a Professor of Ecology and the University of North Florida who studies apex predators in general (and alligators specifically) highlighted a number of factual errors and questionable assumptions in a tweet thread:\n\n1.

Allow me to demonstrate: THREAD https://t.co/JwBYGA9u8v\n\u2014 Adam Rosenblatt (@aroseadam) January 18, 2018\n\nAfter the publication of our article, Mic issued a correction to their story and altered it to largely remove the focus from the purported ecological benefits of Alligator hunting, noting that biologists do not consider the alligator to be overpopulated.\u00a0\nThe first problem with the premise presented in the original\u00a0article was the claim that Louisiana is overpopulated by alligators. Scientifically speaking, overpopulation is a\u00a0specific term that refers to a population of organisms that exceeds the resources (called carrying capacity) inherent to its ecological niche. The article\u00a0provided no evidence (beyond Richard\u2019s quote) that this condition exists. It is worth noting, in fact, that the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries does not consider the alligator species overpopulated. Rather, a fact sheet offered on their website describes the population as \u201cstable.\u201d\nFurthermore, evidence suggest that alligators in Louisiana are not overpopulated. In addition to habitat destruction, Rosenblatt told us, telltale signs of overpopulation include animal starvation and negative population growth. Yet according to the Louisiana DWF (in a document\u00a0linked by the Mic.com article), \u201cAlligator populations in Louisiana increased consistently from 1970 to 1999, have remained stable/slightly increasing for the last 10 years, and currently remain at high levels.\u201d High levels, here, by no means refers to the scientific concept of overpopulation, and is a reference to the fact that the species has recovered from near extinction levels in the 1960s.\nBy far the more problematic claim in the original story, however, was the notion that alligators are actively destroying wetland habitats. This\u00a0article cited the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in a way that misleadingly suggested the research agency endorsed a theory that alligators were contributing to the reduction wetland area in Louisiana:\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, [the wetlands] are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt.\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, [the wetlands] are being lost at a rate of 75 square kilometers annually. In Des Allemands and other bayous like it, you add in the overpopulation of an apex predator into the equation and the effects are deeply felt.\nThe USGS, in that report, listed a number of factors that are contributing to the decline of wetlands, such as human impacts, land use changes, and rising sea level \u2014 but alligators were not mentioned even once. A 2013 study on the future prospects of Louisiana\u2019s wetland ecosystems that summarized the main contributors to habitat loss similarly gave a snub to alligators. Rosenblatt told us he is wholly unaware of any research linking alligators to habitat destruction in Louisiana. \u201cI\u2019ve probably read about 95 percent of the existing scientific literature on alligator ecology,\u201d he added.\nAn additional rationale provided for why hunting (and presumably eating) alligators would provide a net benefit to the ecosystem: that \u201ctoo many alligators means too many fish and turtles being killed.\u201d This assertion, Rosenblatt said, is based on a simplistic and outmoded view of the connection between ecosystems and apex predators. A 2011 paper in Biological Reviews argued that predators often play a vital role in maintaining complex ecosystems:\nTop-order predators often have positive effects on biological diversity [\u2026] Their loss has been identified as a major factor contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of top predators is a critical global imperative.\nTop-order predators often have positive effects on biological diversity [\u2026] Their loss has been identified as a major factor contributing to the decline of biodiversity in both aquatic and terrestrial systems. Consequently, restoring and maintaining the ecological function of top predators is a critical global imperative.\nAlligators in Louisiana, specifically, play an important role in regulating the the wetland ecosystem due to their predation on an invasive rodent known as nutria (introduced for fur trading in the 1930s). That species, unlike the alligator, has significantly degraded at least 100,000 acres of wetland in Louisiana. To reduce complexities of an ecosystem to \u201cturtles and fish = good, alligators = bad\u201d does a disservice to both ecological science and readers interested in understanding it.\nRosenblatt does agree that alligator hunting is \u201can important part of alligator management programs, and alligator meat is delicious,\u201d but he pushes back against the rationale provided by the original article. \u201cAdvocating for hunting because gators are destroying marshes? There\u2019s no evidence for that.\u201d In fact, like the claim of overpopulation, there is evidence against it, Rosenblatt said:\nThe rate of wetland loss in Louisiana has been declining, despite the fact that Louisiana alligator populations have been stable or growing slowly.\nThe rate of wetland loss in Louisiana has been declining, despite the fact that Louisiana alligator populations have been stable or growing slowly.\nThe first version of this article reported on the opinion of an alligator chef without verifying the factual bases underlying his opinions. In truth, no evidence supports either the claim that Louisiana alligators are overpopulated or that their presence is contributing to a loss of wetland habitat.

On Internet forums and blogs, the claims are usually presented anecdotally and are often layered with strong innuendo about what nefarious chemicals PepsiCo, the parent company of Aquafina, could be hiding in their products.\nThe claim resurfaced with a 2016 YouTube video titled \u201cAQUAFINA DOESN\u2019T FREEZE. Why? Antifreeze.. (maybe too, radio-active..),\u201d which has been posted on conspiracy-focused web sites. That video shows a construction worker at a chilly job site perplexed by a number of \u201cpartially consumed,\u201d unfrozen bottles of Aquafina surrounded by a variety of other bottled waters that are frozen solid.\nIt bears mentioning that this video, uploaded by YouTube user \u201cKing Johnny\u201d who captioned it with a lengthy but largely unrelated rant about Monsanto, aspartame, and the Government of Canada, provides no evidence that:\nTherefore this video cannot be used in support of the claim that Aquafina bottled water does not freeze. Similarly, there is no reason to taken it any more seriously than the numerous YouTube videos of Aquafina actually freezing.\nTo those who have taken the King Johnny video at face value, two contradictory hypotheses have been offered:\nNeither explanation holds any water (or ice). Supercooled water exists in a liquid state below the freezing point of water, something that can occur if water contains no impurities and is cooled slowly without disturbance:\n\nThe phenomenon occurs in pure, undisturbed substances which are slowly cooled below the normal freezing (or melting) point. So long as no atoms or molecules join to form a solid nucleus, the sample remains liquid. Once a solid forms [for example, an ice crystal], though, it spreads rapidly through the sample.\n\nThe phenomenon occurs in pure, undisturbed substances which are slowly cooled below the normal freezing (or melting) point. So long as no atoms or molecules join to form a solid nucleus, the sample remains liquid. Once a solid forms [for example, an ice crystal], though, it spreads rapidly through the sample.\nAs Aquafina (and other bottled water) is heavily filtered to remove impurities, it is possible that an unopened, slowly cooled, and undisturbed bottle of water could remain liquid below freezing. Indeed this fact has created a popular genre of YouTube videos showing seemingly magic people instantly freezing bottled water by shaking or opening bottles that have been slowly cooled and left undisturbed or unopened.\nSupercooled liquid does not work as an explanation for the King Johnny video, however, as the bottles were already opened and are therefore likely to contain contaminants necessary to serve as a nucleus for ice crystals.\nThe more paranoid explanation, that some nefarious chemical or chemicals have been added to Aquafina water, is equally problematic. Aquafina water is regularly tested, as are the sources from which it comes, and there is no evidence that it contains any more radioactivity than is expected of anything found in nature.\nConspiracy web site BeforeItsNews.com suggested that the chemical propylene glycol, which is used for a variety of purposes in processed food and drinks, and which has antifreeze properties, could be the cause Aquafina\u2019s purported inability to freeze. However, there is no evidence that the chemical is used in distilled water (none of its usual uses are relevant to the bottling process), and it would take a\u00a0significant amount of the chemical \u2014 which imparts a sweet taste \u2014 to significantly lower the freezing point of a bottle of water.\nVideos purporting to show Aquafina water not freezing as evidence of some chemical abnormality inherent to the beverage are scientifically suspect and impossible to verify. However, because Aquafina water does, in fact, freeze, we rank this claim as false."}, "38": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/time-magazine-cover-global-cooling/", "title": "\tIs This Time Magazine Cover About \u2018Global Cooling\u2019?", "subtitle": "\t\tDespite all their bluster, climate denial blogs still do not appear to understand the difference between weather and climate.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["2 November 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/11/Time_the_big_freeze_cover_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA Time magazine cover from 1977 with the title \u201cThe Big Freeze\u201d is an example of media fearmongering over  \u201cglobal cooling\u201d in the 1970s.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 30 October 2017, climate change denier blog \u201cWatts Up With That?\u201d (which bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s most viewed site on global warming and climate change\u201d) published a guest essay\u00a0by Leo Goldstein.

The 400 studies in this latest piece cover topics wholly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming, including, for example, a study\u00a0on the effect of wind turbines upon the viability of migratory bat populations.\nThe first time that Breitbart ran a NTZ based-story, numerous scientists listed in the report pointed out their their graphs had been digitally\u00a0altered by NTZ to omit data, and that NTZ had either\u00a0misinterpreted\u00a0their papers or read them so superficially that the author of the post did not realize he was sometimes quoting from general background material and not the actual findings of the papers themselves.\nDespite these deficiencies, a 23 October 2017 NTZ post upped the alleged tally of climate change-disproving papers from 58 to 400 (which, to be clear, still includes those previous misrepresented studies).\nWe emailed Delingpole to ask how long it took him to research his piece, given that less than 24 hours elapsed between the original NTZ post and his Breitbart piece. Rather than write back, Delingpole published our query on Breitbart, along with the following response (which read in part):\n\nAs little time as I possibly could.\n\nAs little time as I possibly could.\nSpeaking of his unyielding faith in Kenneth Richard, the author of the New Tricks Zone post, Delingpole said:\nObviously, if it turns out that Kenneth Richard has misrepresented these papers, then yes, I can be criticized for having lazily helped promulgate a lie.\nObviously, if it turns out that Kenneth Richard has misrepresented these papers, then yes, I can be criticized for having lazily helped promulgate a lie.\nRichard misrepresents and misinterprets these papers in many\u00a0instances.

NTZ reported on the graph (below) as if it were evidence that global temperatures were flat, despite the fact that the post had intentionally and explicitly removed that signal:\n\nWithout the removal of the longer term warming trend, that above figure would have looked like this, as presented by the study\u2019s author in a figure plotted for Climate Feedback:\n\nNTZ employs three main strategies: \u00a0straw man arguments that falsely change the evidence for global warming into something that is easier to refute; the inclusion of papers wholly irrelevant to the reality of anthropogenic climate change; and the inclusion of papers (or conference abstracts) that almost certainly underwent little or no peer review process.\nStraw Man Arguments\nA majority of the papers that allegedly prove that \u201cglobal warming is a myth\u201d rest primarily on false representations of what climatologists actually expect to see in the climate system. NTZ is peddling three main false representations:\nStraw Man One: The concept of anthropogenic global warming requires there be no other drivers of climate whatsoever.\nThe categories that fall under this classic straw man argument are the studies highlighting the role of the sun in the climate system (\u201cIt\u2019s the sun stupid\u201d), studies that demonstrate natural oscillations in the climate system (\u201cClimate influenced by natural oscillation\u201d), and studies that show that volcanoes or tectonics have in some way affected the climate in the past (\u201cVolcano/Tectonic Influence on Climate\u201d).\nTo be clear, climate science has never required there to be no influence on the climate from the sun, from volcanoes, or from short term oscillations such as El Ni\u00f1o; in fact, much of climatology involves teasing apart these relationships. However, most of the studies NTZ highlights attempt to use such investigations as evidence that anthropogenic climate change is a myth. Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at the independent Berkeley Earth research group, which was initially (but is no longer) skeptical of global warming, and was originally funded by the Koch brothers, told us:\n\nClimate scientists study things like volcanoes, changes in solar output, changes in the Earth\u2019s orbit, multidecadal natural variability in the Atlantic and Pacific, and other factors that impact climate change.

His request went unheeded, and his work reappears in Breitbart\u2019s October post:\n\nThe article [\u2026] is not a climate-change-denying paper. It is a paleoclimate paper showing, first, a new maximum temperature reconstruction for the last 400 years (including the current warming) and second, a new standardization method in dendrochronology to remove the non-climatic trend.

The image in the post does not by any means reflect the message of the paper.\nDoes the existence of anthropogenic global warming require the pre-industrialized Iberian Peninsula to be unresponsive to volcanic and solar influences? Only if you are aggressively uninterested in trying to understand the science.\nStraw Man Two: The concept of anthropogenic global warming requires every location on earth to respond to climatic variables in the same way.\nA number of studies cited by both Breitbart and NTZ use records from a specific, narrow geographic location to suggest that the world as a whole is not warming. No reasonable climate scientist, however, would argue that this is the case, as Hausfather told us:\n\nIn fact, we expect different parts of the world to warm at different rates (e.g. land warming faster than oceans), and things like precipitation changes have distinct regional patterns. Similarly, not every year will be warmer than the last. Short-term variability driven by El Nino and La Nina cycles can have a big impact on individual year\u2019s temperatures, though it averages out over longer time periods.\n\nIn fact, we expect different parts of the world to warm at different rates (e.g. land warming faster than oceans), and things like precipitation changes have distinct regional patterns.

My paper does not discuss 20th century anthropogenic warming trends, but decadal to centennial variability in the monsoon precipitation of the southern Tibetan Plateau.\nSuch variability has the ability to amplify or attenuate anthropogenic trends in precipitation, and leads to greater uncertainty in projections of future precipitation change. It is certainly not evidence to use to claim that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are not changing the climate\n\nI do not agree with Breitbart\u2019s assessment of my work.

The finding that precipitation fluctuates in complicated and not fully understood ways that are both independent of, and related to, global warming is by no means proof that the world is not warming due to increased greenhouse emissions.\nStraw Man Three: The evidence for anthropogenic global warming is entirely model-based\nMany of the studies included in the NTZ suite of papers include critiques of or refinements to climate models. These studies generally highlight the fact that disagreements and flaws exist in the computer programs used to model an entire heterogeneous global system.\u00a0NTZ and Breitbart present these studies in a way meant to imply that the reality of global warming is dependent on those models, which is wholly false, as Hausfather said:\n\nOur understanding of the reality of global warming really doesn\u2019t depend on climate models. Basic physics going back to the mid-1800s tells us that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will warm the Earth. While modern science has added lots of nuance like carbon cycle feedbacks, ice sheet dynamics, and other complexities of the Earth\u2019s climate, the basics are pretty much unchanged.\n\nOur understanding of the reality of global warming really doesn\u2019t depend on climate models.

While the paper may be an indictment of a particular aspect of a particular model, it is in no way an indictment of the reality of global warming.\nRosenblum told us that the sentences excerpted by Delingpole and NTZ actually came from basic introductory material that \u201cour field already agreed on before we published this paper\u201d:\u00a0\n\nOur paper certainly does not say that \u201cglobal warming is a myth\u201d. It does not say that \u201c\u2018global warming\u2019\u00a0\u2014 as in the big scare story that the planet is heating up at a catastrophic unprecedented rate because of man-made CO2 emissions\u00a0\u2014 is bunk; or that the methods being used to combat the problem are bunk.\u201d\nOur main results showed that the models appear to be too conservative and simulate Arctic sea ice that is not sensitive enough to changes in global temperatures.\n\nOur paper certainly does not say that \u201cglobal warming is a myth\u201d.

The results reveal that [\u2026] greenhouse gas emissions of a battery electric vehicle production [\u2026] are about 50% higher than those of an internal combustion engine vehicle [\u2026]\nThis substantial change can be mainly attributed to the production of traction batteries, the essential components for battery electric vehicles. Moreover, the larger weight and different weight distribution of materials used in battery electric vehicles also contribute to the larger environmental impact. This situation can be improved through the development of new traction battery production techniques, vehicle recycling and a low-carbon energy structure.\n\nIn this study, the life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of vehicle production are compared between battery electric and internal combustion engine vehicles in China\u2019s context.

This includes the most inflammatory papers mentioned, which attempt to discard established principles such as CO2\u2018s importance as a greenhouse gas or make absurd\u00a0claims\u00a0like linking 100 percent of climate change to tectonic activity.\nOne such paper (\u201cThe Correlation of Seismic Activity and Recent Global Warming: 2016 Update\u201d) was authored by a Heritage Foundation researcher and \u201cskeptic\u201d in the journal\u00a0Environment Pollution and Climate Change, which is\u00a0owned by a company\u00a0that the Federal Trade Commission is currently\u00a0suing\u00a0for deceptive practices related to their claims of peer review. This paper, which was submitted three days before it was accepted, was almost certainly not thoroughly peer-reviewed.\nAnother odd inclusion for both Breitbart and NTZ is a commentary\u00a0article (\u201cEnvironmental Reporting in a Post Truth World\u201d) published in an obscure media journal, Asia Pacific Media Educator.\u00a0It is not a scientific study and it cites (among other things) a Daily Mail tabloid story that alleged that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association manipulated data, and that was deemed so inaccurate by a press watchdog group that the Daily Mail was forced to publish a lengthy retraction.\nResponding to our questions about his paper\u2019s inclusion in the story in an expansive e-mail touching on a diverse range of topics (including Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, and the mainstream media), the author of the piece conceded:\n\nMy article is commentary, not a scientific study, it does not merit being counted [in the NTZ list of studies].\n\nMy article is commentary, not a scientific study, it does not merit being counted [in the NTZ list of studies].\nOne paper whose neutrality and \u201cpublished\u201d status can easily and legitimately be called into question is a paper published by European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), an organization whose stated purpose is to reject what they call \u201cclimate policy.\u201d\u00a0\nThat paper, which was published on EIKE\u2019s website (and nowhere else), claims that \u201cour results clearly demonstrate CO2 is a very weak green house gas and cannot be brought into connection with the anthropogenic climate change\u201d\u00a0\u2014 challenging more than a hundred\u00a0years of established science. Breitbart\u2019s reasoning for blindly regurgitating this shoddy research without any due diligence or pretext of editorial restraint was that \u201clife is too short,\u201d and that the boring task of actually reading the scientific papers had already been done for Delingpole by the NTZ blog:\n\nRichard [author of the NTZ post] \u2014 bless his cotton socks \u2014 had taken upon himself the achingly tedious task of wading through these 400 science papers, assessing their skeptical position on \u201cclimate change\u201d, and then highlighting the key passages that supported his argument.\n\nRichard [author of the NTZ post] \u2014 bless his cotton socks \u2014 had taken upon himself the achingly tedious task of wading through these 400 science papers, assessing their skeptical position on \u201cclimate change\u201d, and then highlighting the key passages that supported his argument.\nBecause almost none of the papers cited actually support the argument that global warming is a myth, we rank Delingpole\u2019s loosely researched claim that 400 papers published in 2017 prove such to be false."}, "40": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-confirms-existence-of-earths-second-moon/", "title": "\tNASA Confirms Existence of Earth\u2019s Second Moon?", "subtitle": "\t\tWhile a discovery from 2016 did reveal the presence of a small asteroid trapped in Earth\u2019s orbit, this object cannot be classified as a moon.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["16 October 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/10/earth_quasi-moon_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tNASA has recently confirmed the existence of Earth\u2019s second moon.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 15 June 2016, NASA reported on the discovery of a small asteroid that, by virtue of some of the funkier aspects of orbital mechanics, is stuck alternately following and leading Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun in a highly irregular and circuitous path:\n\nA small asteroid has been discovered in an orbit around the sun that keeps it as a constant companion of Earth, and it will remain so for centuries to come.\nAs it orbits the sun, this new asteroid, designated 2016 HO3, appears to circle around Earth as well.

Instead, the asteroid, which was once in orbit around the Sun, has been caught up in the gravitational pull of our planet in a \u201cquasi-stable\u201d arrangement:\n\nIn its yearly trek around the sun, asteroid 2016 HO3 spends about half of the time closer to the sun than Earth and passes ahead of our planet, and about half of the time farther away, causing it to fall behind. Its orbit is also tilted a little, causing it to bob up and then down once each year through Earth\u2019s orbital plane. In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a game of leap frog with Earth that will last for hundreds of years.\n\nIn its yearly trek around the sun, asteroid 2016 HO3 spends about half of the time closer to the sun than Earth and passes ahead of our planet, and about half of the time farther away, causing it to fall behind.

In effect, this small asteroid is caught in a game of leap frog with Earth that will last for hundreds of years.\nThe second reason 2016 HO3 is not a moon is that its presence in our orbit is likely temporary. Scientists estimate that 2016 HO3 has potentially been trapped in this dance with Earth for around a million years (that sounds like a long time, but it\u2019s a blink of an eye compared to the one-and-only moon\u2019s four billion plus year co-existence with Earth), and that it will likely stay in its current setup for at least another 300 years. It is unlikely, however, to remain a permanent fixture in our neck of the solar system.\nThird, the object is simply too far away. NASA reported in their announcement that the asteroid is\u00a0\u201ctoo distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet.\u201d The closest 2016 HO3 gets to Earth is about\u00a038 times the distance between the Earth and the moon.\nThis is far from the first quasi-satellite of Earth discovered.

Such an occurrence would involve an anomalous loss of water, which would be documentable via a variety of scientifically rigorous methods.\nThe obvious approach would be to look at water levels from areas near the Mississippi River and close to the New Madrid fault and see if the current levels there are lower than usual when compared with historical data, and this is the approach USGS Research Statistician David Smith took when we asked him about the \u201cgoing dry\u201d claim. As an example, he pulled up historical data from a well in the the town of Caruthersville, Missouri, which lies directly over the New Madrid fault and adjacent to the Mississippi River. Its levels were normal (if not higher than average) for this time of year, Smith told us:\nThe Caruthersville well lies directly over the New Madrid Fault and it shows that its is normal for this time of year.

Christy Till, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s School of Earth and Space Exploration, is the lead researcher of the lab responsible for the work, and was a co-author on the presentation, as well.\nThe Times article discussed their findings, which suggested \u2014 in broad brushstrokes \u2014 that chemical changes that occurred\u00a0 prior to the past Yellowstone supereruption happened not on a timescale of millennia, as previously believed, but potentially within mere decades.\nThe Times described the crux of the findings this way:\n\nScientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.\n\nScientists are just now starting to realize that the conditions that lead to supereruptions might emerge within a human lifetime.\nA number of other outlets picked up this story, likely in part because Yellowstone supereruption content is a treasure trove of guaranteed clicks. These stories, as is so often the case, came with increasing levels of inaccuracy, as increasingly sensationalized claims bounced through the Internet echo chamber. By 12 October 2017, the story (as reported by USA Today) had become:\n\nYellowstone supervolcano may blow sooner than thought \u2014 and could wipe out life on the planet.\n\nYellowstone supervolcano may blow sooner than thought \u2014 and could wipe out life on the planet.\nTo be clear, this is in no way what the researchers at Arizona State University (or anyone else in the field of volcanology) were arguing. First, and most importantly, their research does not in any way, shape, or form, change predictions about the likelihood of a supereruption happening within our lifetimes. That risk remains exceedingly\u00a0low.\nTill told us in a telephone interview that her work involves high-resolution chemical sampling of layers in crystals found trapped in rocks (a practice similar to reading past climate information from tree rings). These methods are designed to uncover the nature and timing of chemical changes occurring in magma chambers prior to eruptions.\nIn the case of this specific conference presentation, the topic was the most recent supereruption from the Yellowstone caldera, which occurred 631,000 years ago. Their analysis, achieved by sampling crystals at a resolution of \u201cone-one-hundredth the thickness of a human hair,\u201d suggests that clear and dramatic changes may have occurred in the magma chamber, geologically speaking, shortly before the catastrophic eruption:\n\nOur research is all about the idea that we do see signals in crystals from Yellowstone\u2019s last big eruption 631,000 ago [that could indicate] that there were injections of hotter magma that might have mobilized [cooler magma already in the chamber].\n\nOur research is all about the idea that we do see signals in crystals from Yellowstone\u2019s last big eruption 631,000 ago [that could indicate] that there were injections of hotter magma that might have mobilized [cooler magma already in the chamber].\nThese \u201cinjections\u201d, Till told us, could have occurred just decades before the eruption \u2014 a considerably shorter period of time than some previous ideas about how such processes would work. As such, the research could provide insight into volcanological processes and mechanisms that precede Yellowstone eruptions. This, however, stressed Till, \u201cdoes nothing to suggest that there\u2019s going to be a future eruption.\u201d\nFurther, the chemical signals described in the August presentation are not exclusively indicative of wildly destructive and explosive supereruptions, either. In fact, Till published a paper in 2015 demonstrating similar chemical changes prior to more recent but non-explosive lava flows in Yellowstone.\u00a0\nIlya Bindeman, a professor of volcanology at the University of Oregon unassociated with the ASU team, echoed this point, telling us via e-mail:\n\nMost eruptions at Yellowstone are lava flows [\u2026], they discharge [a] similar or comparable amount of magma without a super eruption. Since 630,000 years ago there have been many [\u2026] such eruptions. These eruptive products also have \u201cshort\u201d diffusion profiles [similar to the ones from the explosive 630,000 year old event] in their crystals, but they erupted quietly.\n\nMost eruptions at Yellowstone are lava flows [\u2026], they discharge [a] similar or comparable amount of magma without a super eruption.

The USGS considers the risk of a caldera-forming apocalypse at Yellowstone in the next couple of thousand years \u201cexceedingly low\u201d.\nReassuringly, the Yellowstone region is constantly monitored for potential signs of trouble, as well. The Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, a collaboration between between the University of Utah, the United States Geological Survey, and the National Park Service, monitors real-time seismic activity, land deformation (from GPS and satellite measurements), and thermal changes or chemical signals from the gases being released (from surface detectors).\nThis kind of predictive work was not the purpose of Till and Shamloo\u2019s research. Their work hopes to uncover a deeper mechanistic understanding of Yellowstone eruptions:\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do is understand that if we do see a signal, what are some other properties that might be causing it to kick in bigger? And what is the timescale associated between that happening in each eruption here?\n[\u2026] We already have very good scientists who monitor the volcano and would be able to give you [\u2026] months to years warning of an eruption.

We\u2019ve all seen the documentaries where a polar bear is desperately clinging to a tiny piece of ice and you just know he\u2019s going to die soon.\nThey article then presents two observations that make the generally factual point that there has been relatively more sea ice in the Arctic and glacial ice on Greenland in 2017 than there have been at specific times in the recent past:\n\nThe latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012. [\u2026]\n[The Danish Polar Portal reports that]: If we rank the annual surface mass balance since 1981 from low to high, the lowest on record was 2011-2012 (38 Gt) and this year is the 5th highest out of the 37 year record.\n\nThe latest figures from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, located at the University of Colorado, show that sea ice extent has increased by 40 percent since 2012.

Zeke Hausfather,\u00a0a research scientist for the independent, nongovernmental Berkeley Earth research group told us in an e-mail that, in this area, pretty much \u201call groups who provide estimates\u201d of global temperature unequivocally point to nearly uninterrupted temperature rises since the 1970s, as shown in this comparison of various estimates produced by the climate and energy policy website Carbon Brief:\n\n\u201cPeople interested in global warming are best-served looking at actual global temperatures,\u201d Hausfather said.\nWhile this temperature trend is uncontroversial and clear, the climate system as a whole is a complex beast with numerous entangled parts. The basic approach to writing a blog post that \u201cdebunks\u201d the concept of global warming is to highlight without explanation various parts of that system at a single point in time. NaturalNews.com is no exception to that basic strategy here.\nArctic Sea Ice\nNatural News cites a climate change denial blog called ClimateDepot.com as evidence of the claim that sea ice has grown 40 percent since 2012. In reality, the claim made by this website was more specific and less useful. In a post dated 18 September 2017, Climate Depot stated:\n\nArctic sea ice extent is up 40% from this date five years ago.\n\nArctic sea ice extent is up 40% from this date five years ago.\n\u201cSea ice extent\u201d is one of many different metrics used to characterize the presence of sea ice, and is generally defined as \u201cthe area of ocean [based on pixels in satellite imagery] where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen\u201d. On the day of 17 September 2017, sea ice extent was indeed higher than it was on 17 September 2012:\n\nThis does not mean, however, that sea ice has grown almost 40 percent since 2012, nor does it mean that the overall trend in arctic sea ice is toward growth \u2014 it hasn\u2019t and it isn\u2019t. The issue here is that sea ice extent is quite variable from year to year, and thus looking at two discrete points is a fairly useless exercise without the full context. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect it to monotonically decrease every year,\u201d Hausfather told us.\u00a0\nThis chart (using data\u00a0from the National Snow and Ice Data Center) shows September sea ice extent compared against the same average used in the maps cited by Climate Depot, showing both this aforementioned variability but also an overall trend of reduced ice extent. Note that the year 2012 was no random year to select for comparison; it is actually the record lowest year in terms of Arctic sea ice extent \u2014 making anything compared to it necessarily higher:\n\nThe overall trend of declining sea ice is even clearer when you look at a different measure: sea ice volume (presented by the Polar Science Center, below). Not only do such records show a clear negative trend, they also show just how anomalous 2012 was as a data point:\n\nIn reality, 2017 was the eighth\u00a0lowest year on record for Arctic sea ice extent since satellite measurements began in 1978. But in no world but the pseudo-scientific fringe internet would the concept of global warming rely on every single year breaking the previous year\u2019s record for sea ice minimum.\nTom Karl, the former director of NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, told us that 2017\u2019s sea ice extent was still much lower than the 1980-2010 average (by two standard deviations), and that, despite claims to the contrary, \u201cone can\u2019t look at a trend over 5 years and say much about the impact of global warming as other factors are also important on these short time scales.\u201d\nGlacial Ice on Greenland\nThe NaturalNews.com approach for glacial ice on Greenland was similarly lacking scale and context. The main source for these arguments was a completely legitimate end-of-year report put out by the Danish Polar Portal, a website run by the Danish Meteorological Institute. In that report, the organization makes this factual statement:\n\nHeavy snow and rain in winter with a relatively short and intermittent summer melt season have left the Greenland ice sheet with more ice than has been usual over the last twenty years \u2014 in fact we have to go back to the 1980s and 90s to see a year similar to this one in terms of snow fall and ice melt.\n\nHeavy snow and rain in winter with a relatively short and intermittent summer melt season have left the Greenland ice sheet with more ice than has been usual over the last twenty years \u2014 in fact we have to go back to the 1980s and 90s to see a year similar to this one in terms of snow fall and ice melt.\nThis statement, and the figures presented by NaturalNews.com, are referring to a metric known as Surface Mass Balance (SMB), which Polar Portal describes:\n\nEach year glaciers gain ice from snow and freezing rain and lose ice by melt that runs off. Adding these together gives the surface mass budget (SMB) in Greenland, the ice sheet typically gains mass from around September to May and loses more mass than it gains in the ablation [melting] season of June, July and August.\n\nEach year glaciers gain ice from snow and freezing rain and lose ice by melt that runs off. Adding these together gives the surface mass budget (SMB) in Greenland, the ice sheet typically gains mass from around September to May and loses more mass than it gains in the ablation [melting] season of June, July and August.\nImportantly, however, this measurement only presents half the picture in terms of how much mass is being lost from year to year from Greenland\u2019s glaciers. That\u2019s because it does not include the rather significant portion of ice that breaks \u2014 or calves \u2014 off into the ocean to melt elsewhere. On average this accounts for about 500 Gt [gigatons] of further ice loss. This, as stated in the Polar Portal post, nearly matches the estimated gain in SMB reported by Natural News, effectively canceling it out.\nIn a post on Carbon Brief, analysts with the Danish Meteorological Society put this year\u2019s measurement in context:\n\nWhile the Greenland ice sheet has seen a neutral, or small positive, change in ice for this year, it should be noted that Greenland has lost approximately 3,600bn tonnes of ice since 2002.\n\nWhile the Greenland ice sheet has seen a neutral, or small positive, change in ice for this year, it should be noted that Greenland has lost approximately 3,600bn tonnes of ice since 2002.\nLike the record of Arctic sea ice earlier, when put in the context of the entire trend of Greenland\u2019s ice mass over time (presented by Polar Portal below), 2017\u2019s measurement does nothing to change larger and completely unambiguous trends of overall melting:\n\u00a0\n\nFurther, in the case of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, there is not much of a mystery surrounding the lackluster amount of melting this year; a massive storm \u2014 the remnants of Hurricane Nicole \u2014 parked itself\u00a0atop the continent, dumping a large amount of snow on the ice-covered continent:\n\nHeavy rain and snow in October in especially eastern Greenland gave record totals of precipitation in the main east coast town of Tasiilaq as the remnants of former hurricane Nicole passed by and, much as with Harvey in Houston this year, got lodged over eastern Greenland for some days. However, after Nicole\u2019s extreme precipitation, the rest of the winter was actually pretty average in terms of the amount of snow that fell.\n\nHeavy rain and snow in October in especially eastern Greenland gave record totals of precipitation in the main east coast town of Tasiilaq as the remnants of former hurricane Nicole passed by and, much as with Harvey in Houston this year, got lodged over eastern Greenland for some days.

The best science can offer outside of probability estimates are warnings\u00a0after an earthquake has occurred but prior to its effects reaching an area further away \u2014 something that provides advance notice on the order of seconds, but which is not, strictly speaking, a prediction.\nESP is not supported by any rigorous science, but even if it were, Kalayil\u2019s claims \u2014 encompassing a four-month period of time and the entirety of an ocean basin that frequently experiences earthquakes \u2014 are pretty vague. What science can tell us is that, based on the geologic record of tsunamis from northern Sumatra that goes back 1,000 years, tsunamis on the scale Kalayil describes in that region are quite rare:\n\nThese findings [\u2026] suggest that damage-causing tsunamis in Aceh [a region in northern Sumatra] recur infrequently enough for entire human lifetimes to typically elapse between them. Such recurrence adds to the challenge of preparing communities along the northern Indian Ocean shorelines for future tsunamis.\n\nThese findings [\u2026] suggest that damage-causing tsunamis in Aceh [a region in northern Sumatra] recur infrequently enough for entire human lifetimes to typically elapse between them.

As of 2014, 74.4 percent of the United States populace has access to water from a fluoridated source, and this practice is employed by countries and cities all around the world.\nAccording to numerous meta-studies, the addition of fluoride (the ionic form of the element fluorine that plays a role in tissue mineralization) to public drinking water significantly reduces the incidence of dental caries.\nModerate voices against the practice of water fluoridation point to concerns over the possible negative health effects of fluoride consumption, and a perceived lack of efficacy in terms of dental benefits.

Considering it is applied to entire populations or certain groups within a population, the definition is chemical warfare- a tool most useful to eugenicists who are intent on depopulation [sic] the planet.\nThese combined efforts have produced myriad confused and self-referential claims that would require multiple posts to debunk. In this particular post, however, we will focus only on the claim that scientific studies have demonstrated that intentional water fluoridation causes neurological damage resulting in a negative effect on a person\u2019s intelligence quotient.\nThat claim, which is based on an either willful or negligent misreading of actual science, is effectively illustrated in this\u00a0statement by Joseph Mercola (emphasis ours):\n\nAt present [December 2014], a total of 42 human studies have linked\u00a0moderately high fluoride exposures with reduced intelligence, and over 100 animal studies have shown that fluoride exposure can cause brain damage.\n\nAt present [December 2014], a total of 42 human studies have linked\u00a0moderately high fluoride exposures with reduced intelligence, and over 100 animal studies have shown that fluoride exposure can cause brain damage.\nThe claim that studies have \u201clinked\u201d fluoride to reduced intelligence is a textbook-ready case of bait-and-switch. In Mercola\u2019s (and many others\u2019) language, the topic has surreptitiously been shifted from the act of water fluoridation as a public health measure to the broader concept of fluoride toxicity in children. Many otherwise benign chemicals can also be harmful in high concentrations. Thiocyanate, a chemical found in\u00a0kale, may kill you at high doses, for example.\nThe most famous and commonly cited study (partially because the anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Now issued a misleading press release about it that was incorrectly\u00a0covered as a Reuters report by a number of newspapers) used to link fluoride to reduced IQ was published by a team of Harvard researchers. This\u00a0paper, a meta-analysis of previously conducted studies that compared populations of children exposed to various levels of naturally occurring fluoride in their water, concluded:\n\nFindings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children\u2019s intelligence. Children who lived in areas with high fluoride exposure had lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-exposure or control areas.\n\nFindings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children\u2019s intelligence. Children who lived in areas with high fluoride exposure had lower IQ scores than those who lived in low-exposure or control areas.\nScale and context, which are so often ignored by the evangelists of pseudoscience, are crucial when interpreting the results of this analysis, however.\nFirst, the issue of scale. As neuroscientist Steven Novella pointed out in his Neurologica blog, most of these studies\u2019 \u201chigh fluoride\u201d groups used concentrations many times higher than allowable limits in the United States, and many of the control groups or \u201clow fluoride\u201d groups had concentrations in the range that is actually targeted as optimal by water fluoridation regulations:\n\nThere was a lot of variability across the studies, but generally the high fluoride groups were in the 2-10 mg/L range, while the reference low fluoride groups were in the 0.5-1.0 mg/L range [\u2026]\nIn other words \u2013 fluoridated water in the US has the same level of fluoride as the control or low fluoride groups in the China studies reviewed in the recent article, and the negative association with IQ was only found where fluoride levels were much higher \u2013 generally above EPA limits.\n\nThere was a lot of variability across the studies, but generally the high fluoride groups were in the 2-10 mg/L range, while the reference low fluoride groups were in the 0.5-1.0 mg/L range [\u2026]\nIn other words \u2013 fluoridated water in the US has the same level of fluoride as the control or low fluoride groups in the China studies reviewed in the recent article, and the negative association with IQ was only found where fluoride levels were much higher \u2013 generally above EPA limits.\nCurrently, the EPA\u2019s maximum allowable\u00a0limit for fluoride in drinking water is 4 mg/L with a voluntary recommendation of 2 mg/L. When fluoride is added to a public water supply, the target concentration is 0.7 mg/L.\nSupporters of the notion that this Harvard paper\u2019s collection of studies still suggests developmental risks of fluoridation at levels used in public health programs might argue that eight of the studies analyzed in the meta-review focused on concentrations allegedly within this allowable range. This is a factual point that deserves further investigation, as a close look at these eight studies reveals that their contribution to the fluoridation debate is dubious at best.\nOf those eight studies, half of them co-investigated fluoride and iodine together (Lin et al 1991, Xu et al 1994, Yang et al 1994, Hong et al 2001) making it hard or in some cases impossible to separate out the combined effects, and two of those four studies reached conclusions that are counter to the hypothesis that fluoridation levels alone are the main driver of a lower IQ:\n\nXu et al 1994:\nWhen it comes to the parents\u2019 level of education, and the children\u2019s exposure (or lack thereof) to pre-school education, sIgnificant differences in the intelligence level in the young subjects are shown in both regions affected by thyroid swelling, and their comparative regions. This demonstrates that levels of IQ are not only affected by the amount of trace elements in the environment, but also by social factors such as the education of the subjects, the type of education. and training they are exposed to, etc These social factors most definitely play an important role in this type of research.\nHong et al 2001:\nThe IQ results of this study show no significant difference between the average IQs of those children from the high fluoride only areas and the high fluoride/high iodine areas, however the result from the high fluoride/low iodine group show statistically significant differences as compared to that of the low fluoride/low iodine group. In short, it appears that the presence or lack of iodine is a more significant factor in both the prevalence of goiter and average IQ [than fluoride levels alone].\n\nXu et al 1994:\nWhen it comes to the parents\u2019 level of education, and the children\u2019s exposure (or lack thereof) to pre-school education, sIgnificant differences in the intelligence level in the young subjects are shown in both regions affected by thyroid swelling, and their comparative regions. This demonstrates that levels of IQ are not only affected by the amount of trace elements in the environment, but also by social factors such as the education of the subjects, the type of education. and training they are exposed to, etc These social factors most definitely play an important role in this type of research.\nHong et al 2001:\nThe IQ results of this study show no significant difference between the average IQs of those children from the high fluoride only areas and the high fluoride/high iodine areas, however the result from the high fluoride/low iodine group show statistically significant differences as compared to that of the low fluoride/low iodine group. In short, it appears that the presence or lack of iodine is a more significant factor in both the prevalence of goiter and average IQ [than fluoride levels alone].\nAmong the eight studies, two of them (Yao et al 1997, Seraj et al 2006) do not appear to actually measure the water intake of the regions in which they are observing differences in intelligence quotient,\u00a0or at the very least they do not report the total range of values for each region, or any statistical information regarding those values.\nTwo of those eight studies use a control group with fluoride values that are literally the same or higher than the target range of fluoridation efforts in the United States (Xu et al 1994, Hong et al 2001), seemingly ceding the point that those levels do not affect children\u2019s IQ.\nFinally, four of these eight papers (Yang et al 1994, Lu et al 2000, Hong et al 2001, Xiang et al 2003a) are either published (or republished) in the allegedly peer-reviewed journal Fluoride, a publication of the \u201cInternational Society for Fluoride Research Inc.\u201d \u2014 an anti-fluoridation group whose editor-in-chief is a psychiatrist in private practice, with no academic background on the topic of fluoride toxicity.\nCollectively, this demonstrates that most of the IQ variance presented in the Harvard study still stems from exposures to extremely high levels of fluoride that would already be considered dangerous in the US, and those studies finding effects on a smaller scale are not sufficient to demonstrate the effects those groups opposed to fluoridation claim they demonstrate.\nThe next issue is context. Literally none of the studies involved tested populations of individuals exposed to drinking water that was artificially supplemented with fluoride as a public health measure. Instead, all of the studies come from China or Iran, both of which have areas of naturally occurring (endemic) high fluoride pockets of groundwater.\nThat means that studies utilized in its analysis are wholly irrelevant to the question that advocates claim they are answering. This is significant, as the use of these very specific studies introduces a veritable Homerian epic of confounding details, some of which came up in our analysis of the eight low-level fluoride studies discussed above. Among the most pressing of these are a lack of information on other confounding variables and the quality of the studies they utilized. These issues are noted by the authors of the Harvard study themselves:\n\n\u201cMost reports were fairly brief and complete information on covariates was not available\u201d\n\u201cDrinking water may contain other neurotoxicants, such as arsenic\u201d\n\u201cThe studies [used in the meta-analysis] were generally of insufficient quality\u201d\n\n\u201cMost reports were fairly brief and complete information on covariates was not available\u201d\n\u201cDrinking water may contain other neurotoxicants, such as arsenic\u201d\n\u201cThe studies [used in the meta-analysis] were generally of insufficient quality\u201d\nThe authors also explicitly\u00a0state that the results cannot be used to estimate the possible limits of fluoride exposure with respect to developmental damage, due to lack of data:\n\nOur review cannot be used to derive an exposure limit, because the actual exposures of the individual children are not known.\n\nOur review cannot be used to derive an exposure limit, because the actual exposures of the individual children are not known.\nThe data could also be complicated by other factors not accounted for, they say, including the notion that the populations of individuals compared may not actually\u00a0reflect their fluoride intake:\n\nMisclassification of children in both high- and low-exposure groups may have occurred if the children were drinking water from other sources [\u2026]\n\nMisclassification of children in both high- and low-exposure groups may have occurred if the children were drinking water from other sources [\u2026]\nRegarding the other neurotoxins that could be in the water, the authors of the Harvard Study make the (unsourced) claim that it is unlikely that other neurotoxicants are present in the groundwater of the areas their studies investigated. As many of the studies did not measure for other compounds, it is impossible to be sure in these specific cases; however,\u00a0geochemists are not convinced that the same natural processes that lead to high fluoride concentrations don\u2019t also yield high concentrations of other dangerous metals.\nResearch has, for example, shown that there is a strong correlation between arsenic and fluoride in drinking water, according to\u00a0a 2011\u00a0study in Applied Geochemistry analyzing groundwater in Yuncheng Basin, China:\n\nThe strong positive correlation between groundwater F/Cl and As/Cl ratios (r2 = 0.98 and 0.77 in shallow and deep groundwater, respectively) indicates that these elements are mobilized and enriched by common processes.\n\nThe strong positive correlation between groundwater F/Cl and As/Cl ratios (r2 = 0.98 and 0.77 in shallow and deep groundwater, respectively) indicates that these elements are mobilized and enriched by common processes.\nThis should not function as a distraction from the larger point that studying naturally occurring pockets of high fluoride and the assessing the risks of supplementing public drinking water in an effort to have it reach a concentration of 0.7 mg/L are two completely different beasts.\nYou might ask if any studies have been completed specifically on the effects of IQ on artificially enhanced drinking water. The most recent analysis of these studies comes from an 2015 evidence\u00a0review performed by the government of Ireland\u2019s Health Research Board, which found only one study sufficient to test that hypothesis:\n\nThere was only one study carried out in a non-endemic or CWF [community water fluoridation] area that examined fluoride and IQ. This was a prospective cohort study (whose design is appropriate to infer causality) in New Zealand. The study concluded that there was no evidence of a detrimental effect on IQ as a result of exposure to CWF.\n\nThere was only one study carried out in a non-endemic or CWF [community water fluoridation] area that examined fluoride and IQ. This was a prospective cohort study (whose design is appropriate to infer causality) in New Zealand. The study concluded that there was no evidence of a detrimental effect on IQ as a result of exposure to CWF.\nFor these reasons, the claim that there are scientific studies that support the notion that water fluoridation can cause developmental problems in children that result in lower IQs is false. No studies that actually investigate that specific question have reached that conclusion. Studies that have been used to make that argument are weak and rely on data collected that does not directly address those questions in the first place.\nUpdate:\u00a0\nOn 19 September 2017, the journal Environmental Health Perspectives published a study (\u201cPrenatal Fluoride Exposure and Cognitive Outcomes in Children at 4 and 6\u201312 Years of Age in Mexico\u201d) that found an association between prenatal exposure to fluoride and reduced IQ in mother-offspring pairs in Mexico.\nWhile the study is stronger than many used to draw a connection between IQ and fluoride in the past, it is a single study that has yet to be replicated, and it was performed in areas without water fluoridation. As such, it does not change our rating, which specifically concerns the evidence that water fluoridation reduces IQ."}, "46": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/category-7-harvey-irma/", "title": "\tDid a 2005 Movie Feature Hurricanes Named Harvey and Irma?", "subtitle": "\t\tAn online conspiracy theory about government-created hurricanes gets even the most basic facts wrong.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDan MacGuill\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["8 September 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/category_7_movie_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe 2005 movie Category 7: The End of the World predicted the arrival of hurricanes named Harvey and Irma.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn September 2017, rumors emerged on social media that a 2005 movie predicted current events by featuring two hurricanes named Harvey and Irma \u2014 and that this somehow proved that the hurricanes were both human-engineered.\nA typical viral message read as follows:\n11 years and 9 months ago a movie came out called \u201cCategory 7 End of the World\u201d and there were only two episodes called \u201cHarvey\u201d and \u201cIrma\u201d!

This is way too much of a \u201ccoincidence\u201d for even the casual observer to ignore.\u00a0\nCategory 7: End of the World was a two-part made-for-TV movie broadcast by CBS in November 2005. It\u2019s an apocalyptic thriller directed by Dick Lowry and starring Shannon Doherty about a series of extreme weather events that cause destruction around the world.\nIn the movie, a hurricane named Eduardo strikes Florida and Washington, D.C., while an unnamed Category 6 storm hits New York. Eventually the two combine, causing the movie\u2019s eponymous Category 7 storm, which threatens a global catastrophe.\u00a0\nNone of the storms or hurricanes in the movie was named Harvey or Irma. Furthermore, Category 7: End of the World was broadcast in November 2005, which was 11 years and 10 months (not nine months) before Hurricane Irma\u2019s expected landfall in Florida on 10 September 2017. So the meme\u2019s two key claims were false.\u00a0\nHowever, even if these claims were accurate, they would have no sinister meaning.\u00a0\nAtlantic hurricanes are named from a prescribed list of names that are rotated every six years and published in advance. So we already know the list of potential hurricane names for 2018, 2019, and every year for the foreseeable future, unless they are changed by the World Meteorological Association.\u00a0\nThere was a Hurricane Harvey, for example, in 2011 and\u00a0a Tropical Storm Harvey in\u00a02005\u00a0and 1999. Had the filmmakers named their fictional storms Harvey or Irma, they could easily have chosen them from the same publicly available list.\nEven if there had been 11 years and 9 months between the original broadcast of Category 7: End of the World, and Hurricane Irma\u2019s expected landfall, this would be a meaningless coincidence.\nTo believe otherwise requires believing a vast, unfeasibly complicated conspiracy theory involving the movie\u2019s writers, directors, CBS, and the federal government, who would then have to engineer and manage a tropical storm into a powerful hurricane (something that is impossible) and time its development to perfection so that it makes landfall in the United States on 11 September 2017 exactly.\nIn reality, Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the continental U.S. on 10 September 2017.\u00a0\nHowever, again, even if the post had gotten the dates right, the idea that they contain significance is an example of cherry-picking numerical patterns (which exist everywhere) and contorting them to fit pre-existing beliefs and theories. We have addressed such pattern-seeking previously, in the context of both hurricanes and terrorist attacks.\nThe \u201cCategory 7\u201d meme consists of a ludicrous conspiracy theory based on evidence-free claims about government \u201cgeoengineering\u201d and numerology, and ignores the fact that hurricane names are made public years in advance. Furthermore, its two key factual claims \u2013 that the hurricanes in the movie were named Harvey and Irma, and that the movie was released 11 years and nine months ago \u2013 are false.\u00a0"}, "47": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hurricane-irma-track-become-category-6-storm/", "title": "\tIs Hurricane Irma on Track to Become a \u2018Category 6\u2019 Storm?", "subtitle": "\t\tA rumor that scientists would create a new hurricane category for Irma led people to believe that the storm had already received that designation.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["5 September 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/hurricane_irma_satellite_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tHurricane Irma is projected to be so big that it may become a \"Category 6\" hurricane; that a new \"Category 6\" will be invented specifically for Hurricane Irma\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey, and in light of the increasing strength of Hurricane Irma, numerous alarmist headlines have suggested that Irma is so strong that it should be identified as a \u201cCategory 6\u201d hurricane.

The highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is a five, which contains all storms with sustained winds greater than 157 mph.\nThe idea that Irma is a Category 6 storm seems to have originated with a a blog post\u00a0that implied that a new category, Category 6, would be created for Irma. While the post does not state this directly, its headline reads\u00a0\u201cCategory 6?

But that discussion began well before the 2017 hurricane season. Snyder juxtaposes quotes about Irma with quotes about the need for a new Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale category in a way that is confusing for readers:\u00a0\n\nSo how powerful could Irma eventually become? According to Michael Ventrice of the Weather Channel, Irma could easily become a \u201csuper typhoon\u201d with \u201csustained speeds of over 180mph\u201d [\u2026]\nThe scale we have right now really never envisioned storms that powerful.\u00a0 In fact, some have suggested that we need to add a \u201ccategory 6\u201d to describe the kind of \u201csuper storms\u201d that are now developing in the Atlantic.\n\nSo how powerful could Irma eventually become?

With climate change, these probabilities can increase significantly over the twenty-first century (to 1/3,100\u20131/1,100 in the middle and 1/2,500\u20131/700 towards the end of the century for Tampa). Worse grey swan tropical cyclones, inducing surges exceeding 11 m in Tampa and 7 m in Dubai, are also revealed with non-negligible probabilities, especially towards the end of the century.\n\nGrey swan tropical cyclones striking Tampa, Cairns and Dubai can generate storm surges of about 6 m, 5.7 m and 4 m, respectively, with estimated annual exceedance probabilities [the likelihood of a storm generating surges higher than that] of about 1/10,000.

No scientist or meteorologist has suggested that Irma alone is reason to create a new category.\u00a0\nIt is true that Hurricane Irma is a strong and dangerous storm.

A hundred million years ago, for the record, is roughly a hundred million years before modern homo sapiens sapiens\u00a0actually evolved, give or take a couple 100,000\u00a0years.

We Are One\u201d (EWAO), which suggests that a photograph from a mountain range first discovered\u00a0in 1935 is now breaking news:\n\nRecently, Google Earth satellite imagery discovered a constellation of three snow-covered pyramids in Antarctica. Scientists and researchers are, admittedly, rather taken aback. Two of the three pyramids are about 10 miles inland, while the third is directly near the coastline.\nThe implications? Well, this discovery could end up re-writing our entire history. No research has ever mentioned a civilization in Antarctica, much less one with the technological know-how to construct pyramids.

Well, this discovery could end up re-writing our entire history. No research has ever mentioned a civilization in Antarctica, much less one with the technological know-how to construct pyramids. So, how did these pyramids get there?\nWithout actually answering that question, EWAO then lists a litany of undeniably cool, but wholly irrelevant facts about the geologic history of Antarctica, even including some that are not completely incorrect:\n\nOver millions of years, Antarctica has drifted from a position closer to the equator to its present perma-frozen location.\n\nOver millions of years, Antarctica has drifted from a position closer to the equator to its present perma-frozen location.\nWhat EWAO describes here is plate tectonics \u2014 the foundational theory of modern geology that has been well accepted since the\u00a01960s and was first\u00a0presented as \u201ccontinental drift\u201d in the early 1900s. In fact, one of the first suggestions that Antarctica may have been warmer in the past came from the discovery of 250-million-year-old fossils of plants in Antarctica by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott during a 1912 expedition, which later provided support for the concept.\nEWAO then unnecessarily cites a scientist at the British Antarctic Survey who (factually) stated that there was lush vegetation on the continent 100 million years ago. EWAO presumably does this so they can write the words \u201cThe British Antarctic Survey backs this up\u201d, also presumably hoping that the reader wouldn\u2019t catch on that the Survey was talking about long-established science rather than the complete redefinition of evolutionary history and wholesale rejection of the geologic and archeological records.\nThe final bit of supporting evidence for an ancient civilization capable of making 4,000-foot-tall structures (which, it should be noted, would be a remarkable feat given the fact that this would be ten times the height of the Great Pyramids of Giza) is information provided by a series of expeditions to Antarctica\u2019s Lake Vida, which, in EWAO\u2019s words, \u201cdiscovered unexpected microbial lifeforms trapped under a 65-foot-thick sheet of ice [that] resemble descendants of microorganisms from much warmer climates\u201d.\nThe discovery of these organisms was notable, given the extreme\u00a0environment and their ability to reproduce once\u00a0thawed, but not because of some purported resemblance to more temperate species of bacteria. One could make the equally factual argument that penguins share resemblance with animals from a warmer climate, because as birds they evolved from theropod\u00a0dinosaurs that inhabited an ice-free Earth. Such an observation would be equally useless.\nDespite the irrelevance of the allegedly supporting information provided, EWAO concludes:\n\nAbout 100 million years ago, someone was building pyramids on the Antarctica that was then located at the equator.\n\nAbout 100 million years ago, someone was building pyramids on the Antarctica that was then located at the equator.\nIgnoring the fact that Antarctica has been in its present latitude for the past 100 million\u00a0years (its most recent warm periods were caused by climatic factors, not tectonics), the question EWAO should have been answering is this: Why would a mountain look like a pyramid?\nThe answer to that question is that pyramidal peaked mountains, also called a horn\u00a0(as in Matterhorn), are a feature of glaciated areas; they form from the convergence of glaciers that scour the sides of an existing landmass. This is a great explanation for the pyramid shaped mountains highlighted by EWAO, as they exist at the convergence of multiple ice sheets on a continent noted for its nearly 100 percent glaciated surface.\nTherefore, we rank this claim as false because, as University of California, Irvine geology professor Eric Rignot told LiveScience in 2016: \u201cThis is just a mountain that looks like a pyramid.\u201d"}, "49": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fukushima-officials-never-eat-pacific-fish-again/", "title": "\tDid Fukushima Officials Warn that Humans Should Never Eat Fish Again?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe claim comes from a 2013 blog post about preparing for the collapse of civilization, but it is just as wrong now as it was then.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["10 August 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/ocean_fish_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tFukushima scientists have warned that fish in the Pacific Ocean will never again be safe for human consumption due to radioactive contamination\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 5 August 2017, the conspiracy-peddling website Your News Wire published a story \u2014 devoid of any citations or named sources \u2014 with the headline \u201cFukushima Officials: Humans Should Never Eat Fish Again.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cFukushima scientists,\u201d the writer claims, have concluded that \u201cthe days of eating fish from the Pacific ocean are well and truly over\u201d thanks to widespread contamination from the 2011 tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster:\n\nAccording to one scientist, TEPCO [Tokyo Electric Power Company], the company in charge of monitoring the plant, has data that shows radiation pouring into the Pacific Ocean non-stop for the past six years.\nAccording to other scientists who have examined the radiation levels of fish in the ocean, the days of \u201ceating fish from the Pacific ocean are over\u201d.\n\nAccording to one scientist, TEPCO [Tokyo Electric Power Company], the company in charge of monitoring the plant, has data that shows radiation pouring into the Pacific Ocean non-stop for the past six years.\nAccording to other scientists who have examined the radiation levels of fish in the ocean, the days of \u201ceating fish from the Pacific ocean are over\u201d.\nIf the phrase \u201cyour days of eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are over\u201d sounds familiar, it\u2019s because this quote has been used in a variety of fear-mongering posts related to Fukushima since 2013.\u00a0The claim doesn\u2019t originate with a scientist, but with a man named Gary Stamper, who wrote an opinion piece\u00a0for the Collapsing into Consciousness blog\u00a0\u2014 a web site and forum devoted to issues surrounding the collapse of civilization.\nMany of the claims made in the Stamper piece stem from fears and media reports generated by a 5 August 2013 admission from TEPCO\u00a0that waters leaking from Fukushima reactors into the Pacific were more radioactive than previously reported.

However, claims that this contamination has been continuing at the same rate into the present are incorrect, according to director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Center for Marine and Environmental Radioactivity, who spoke to PBS Newshour in 2016 about this very topic:\n\nMore than 80 percent of the radioactivity from the damaged reactors ended up in the Pacific \u2014 far more than reached the ocean from Chernobyl or Three Mile Island.

This fish had an unambiguous chemical marker linking it to the Fukushima reactor. However the level of radiation detected was equal to or less than the amount of radiation found naturally in any fish in the Pacific Ocean, and was therefore not indicative of a direct health risk.\nWe rate this claim as false because it misrepresents a questionable blog post as a scientific investigation in order to use a flashy quote, and further challenges credibility by mixing together a variety of out-of-date themes based on blog posts from four years before."}, "50": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/perseid-meteor-shower-largest/", "title": "\tWill 2017\u2019s Perseid Meteor Shower Be the Brightest in Recorded Human History?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe reason the web site that originally made this claim cites zero sources is likely due to the fact that there is a complete lack of factual information to support it.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["1 August 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/08/Perseid_meteor_shower_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe 2017 Perseid Meteor shower will be the brightest meteor shower in recorded human history.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 26 July 2017, Astronomy-Physics.com published a now-viral story\u00a0reporting that this year\u2019s Perseid meteor shower will be the brightest meteor shower in human history:\n\nThere is going to be a meteor shower on 12th of August, 2017.

This meteor shower is being considered as once [sic] in a lifetime opportunity as the next meteor shower of such kind will be after 96 years.\nThe meteor shower in question, the Perseids, will indeed peak on 12 August 2017 (though meteors from this shower can be seen from the end of July through the end of August).\nUnfortunately, as exciting as it sounds, claims that this will be the brightest meteor shower in recorded human history are woefully unsupported. In fact, this year\u2019s Perseid meteor shower will likely not even be the brightest Perseid shower of the past two years, according to NASA\u2019s \u201c2017 Meteor Shower Activity Forecast for Earth Orbit\u201d:\n\nMost meteor showers will display typical activity levels in 2017. Perseid activity is expected to be higher than normal but less than in 2016; rates may reach 80% of the [number of meteors a single viewer would see in an hour of peak activity] in 2016.\n\nMost meteor showers will display typical activity levels in 2017. Perseid activity is expected to be higher than normal but less than in 2016; rates may reach 80% of the [number of meteors a single viewer would see in an hour of peak activity] in 2016.\nThat 2016 Perseid shower, despite being above average, was also not the largest Perseid meteor shower ever recorded. That award goes to the 1993 Perseids, according to NASA Meteoroid Environment Office director Bill Cooke. He told us:\n\nEven last year [\u2026] didn\u2019t rival 1993, when the Perseid rates topped 300 per hour\u2026. The best Perseid shower we have a record of occurred back in 1993.\n\nEven last year [\u2026] didn\u2019t rival 1993, when the Perseid rates topped 300 per hour\u2026. The best Perseid shower we have a record of occurred back in 1993.\nThat event actually grounded the Space Shuttle at that time. Still, despite some good fireballs produced by the Perseids in years past, the Perseid shower, in general, is likely not the right one to look at if you are interested in seeing something truly record-setting \u2014 both the Leonids and the Draconids, historically, have produced showers far more intense, Cooke told us:\n\nThe Perseids are not noted for producing what we would consider very spectacular meteor showers. The Leonids and the Draconids, in the past, have produced far more spectacular meteor showers than the Perseids. The Leonid meteor shower has had rates hit 100,000 per hour, which is enormous.\n\nThe Perseids are not noted for producing what we would consider very spectacular meteor showers. The Leonids and the Draconids, in the past, have produced far more spectacular meteor showers than the Perseids. The Leonid meteor shower has had rates hit 100,000 per hour, which is enormous.\nThe Perseids occur each year when Earth passes through the trail of debris left behind by the massive Swift-Tuttle comet. The intensity of a meteor shower is, generally speaking, a function of\u00a0two\u00a0things: the light environment at the time of viewing, and the thickness of the debris trail through which Earth passes. The exact nature of the trail of debris at that point dictates the nature of the meteors one can expect to hit the atmosphere. The light environment is most affected by the phase of the moon, and it determines how bright a meteor must be to be visible.\nWhile the region Earth will be passing through is expected to generate an above-average number of meteors, the phase of the moon \u2014 it will be nearly full at the Perseid peak \u2014 may well cancel out that benefit. \u201cGiven the moon and the fact that the rates are slightly better than normal, you may end up with a normal looking display this year,\u201d Cooke told us.\nAs there is no evidence to support the claim that this year\u2019s event will be the brightest shower in the recorded human history and plenty of evidence to refute it, we rank this claim as false."}, "51": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-data-global-warming/", "title": "\tDoes NASA Data Show That Global Warming Isn\u2019t Causing a Sea Level Rise?", "subtitle": "\t\tDubious web sites generously provided the Internet with textbook examples of both cherry-picked data and the shameless conflation of weather with climate.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["1 August 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/sea_level_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA recent hiatus in sea level rise conflicts with the scientific consensus regarding global warming.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 26 July 2017, supplement and paranoia peddling website NaturalNews.com made a sweeping conclusion about climate change based on a portion of a single chart they found.

It shows a period of generally flat sea level rise. Astute chart readers, however, may note that there have been a number of times throughout the record in which sea level rise has been flat, or even briefly reversed, before continuing the more dominant rising trend. According to University of New South Wales climatologist and sea level expert John Church, this is the reason the \u201cmedia\u201d is \u201csilent\u201d on the issue; in fact, it is in no way newsworthy:\n\nThe short term fall over the last year or so reported on the Natural News website is nothing out of the ordinary and in fact the fall seems less than several previous examples of sea level fall, such as [the drop documented in 2010-2011].\u00a0 It does not seem to be a particularly noteworthy event.\n\nThe short term fall over the last year or so reported on the Natural News website is nothing out of the ordinary and in fact the fall seems less than several previous examples of sea level fall, such as [the drop documented in 2010-2011].\u00a0 It does not seem to be a particularly noteworthy event.\nTo understand why the event is not noteworthy, one needs to understand both the short- and long-term drivers of sea level change. From a long-term global perspective, there are two primary drivers of sea level rise: the first is the balance between water trapped in ice and water contained within the ocean itself. Simply put, when ice that is trapped on land melts, it increases the volume of water in the ocean, causing sea level to rise.\nThe second major driver is known as thermal expansion \u2014 when water gets warmer it expands, increasing its volume. Research suggests that these two contributors alone explain 75 percent of the observed sea level rise since 1971.\nThese larger trends, however, can be dampened (or enhanced) by shorter term weather patterns. The most important\u00a0factors to consider on this time-scale are the El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a cycle (which affects both water temperature, as well as evaporation and precipitation of moisture) and the hydrological issues associated with where rainwater falls on land. The best illustration of these factors combining to alter the overall trend of sea level rise is the 2010-2011 drop in sea level mentioned above.\nIn this instance, the confluence of La Ni\u00f1a and a number of other atmospheric circulation patterns forced an anomalously large amount of rain to fall over the uniquely bowl-shaped continent of Australia, as described by Scientific American:\n\nIn most cases, though, water that falls on land eventually drains into the ocean. Even if a whole lot of rain fell in South America\u2019s Amazon, for example, it could slow sea-level rise for only about a couple of months, as it slowly made its way to the sea.\nSo in order to make sea levels fall, the water had to be stored in a place where it didn\u2019t reach the ocean for a long while. That place, it turns out, was Australia. [\u2026]\nLake Eyre is the lowest point in Australia. It\u2019s usually a dry, salty flat. But when it rains heavily, the basin fills, and the lake teems with new life, as long-dormant seeds spring to life and birds flock to the lake.\nFrom 2010 to 2011, enough rain fell on Australia to fill the lower part of the lake almost completely, and the upper portion at least 75 percent. Australia got about a foot of rain more than normal over that period, said [National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist John] Fasullo.\nThe continent stored that excess water for long enough to change global sea levels.\nThat the world\u2019s smallest continent can affect global sea levels this way is pretty extraordinary, said Fasullo. It\u2019s also rare. [\u2026]\nIn addition to La Ni\u00f1a, other climate variations also played a role. Together, they forced the extraordinary rainfall and water storage in the Australian continent.\n\nIn most cases, though, water that falls on land eventually drains into the ocean.

Together, they forced the extraordinary rainfall and water storage in the Australian continent.\nEventually, of course, this water evaporates and returns to the ocean, where it joins the expanding and increasing global ocean reservoir. We spoke to Fasullo \u2014 the lead author on the study that documented the cause of the 2010-2011 drop in sea level \u2014 about this current hiatus, and he told us it in no way conflicts with our understanding of the connection between global warming and sea level rise:\n\nOf course, this leveling does not conflict with our understanding of sea level rise and its main drivers. It is well known for example that sea level falls (in an anomalous sense) at the end of an El Ni\u00f1o due to drought subsiding over many tropical land areas such as the Amazon (water moves from the ocean to land surface) and heat being released from the ocean (as the tropical upper Pacific Ocean releases heat to the atmosphere, causing contraction).\n[The] recent leveling of sea level rise comes on the heels of an unprecedented rate of rise during the four years that preceded it (2011-14). In addition to global warming, this rise was also strongly influenced by the El Ni\u00f1o-La Ni\u00f1a cycle and so it too should not be oversold.\n\nOf course, this leveling does not conflict with our understanding of sea level rise and its main drivers.

Due to a variety of atmospheric circulation patterns and variations, temperatures vary from year to year as does rainfall, etc., the recent 4 year drought in the west is a good example.\n\nOne or two or three years of weather means very little in the long-term record of sea-level rise just as it would have very little meaning for global temperature records.

In kinesin they move over longer distances with coordinated steps. In myosin, which is most famous for the processes that drive muscle contractions, those latching molecules operate independently of each other, and the system produces more of a single tug than a coordinated strut.\u00a0\nWhile scientists have not produced actual images or videos of such molecules with the clarity of this visualization, increasingly precise microscopic techniques and tools have allowed a detailed characterizations and direct observations of their movement.

Only one person, George Wolff \u2014 a former Environmental Protection Agency atmospheric scientist who is now chief scientist for a company called Air Improvement Resource, Inc. \u2014\u00a0responded to our request. In a brief response, he simultaneously suggested that their inclusion on the document meant to imply they were the peer-reviewers, and that this process involved merely reading the study carefully:\n\nMy approach to reviewing the report was the same as I have used for the hundreds of journal articles that I have reviewed.\u00a0 I read the report carefully and critically.\u00a0 I gave it a formal peer-review.\n\nMy approach to reviewing the report was the same as I have used for the hundreds of journal articles that I have reviewed.\u00a0 I read the report carefully and critically.\u00a0 I gave it a formal peer-review.\nReading a study and saying that you agree with its conclusions is not how peer review works. A formal\u00a0peer-review is a structured process that by nature requires a third party, usually a journal editor, who oversees an iterative process of critiques and revisions.\nGiven the fact that this study is not published in a journal but on a WordPress blog run by one of the co-authors, it is difficult to see how Wolff\u2019s careful and critical reading of the document constitutes a formal peer review. In response to multiple requests for clarification on what Wolff meant by \u201cformal peer review\u201d, he indicated that the conversations were between only himself and the lead author, making the suggestion of peer review more philosophical than an argument rooted in objective reality:\n\nI provided critical comments to the lead author.\u00a0 We then discussed them and appropriate changes were made to the report.\n\nI provided critical comments to the lead author.\u00a0 We then discussed them and appropriate changes were made to the report.\nBreitbart\u2019s Coverage of this \u201cStudy\u201d\nThe main argument of the Breitbart article via this \u201cstudy\u201d appears to be that if you look at global surface temperature records compiled by a variety of governmental organizations, corrections applied to this data since the 1980s have steadily biased the results toward making current warming appear more dramatic by depressing past temperatures and inflating recent temperatures.\nDelingpole even picked out his favorite chart that he claims makes this point:\n\nThis chart shows the difference in the corrected global temperature values, by month, from a National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) record produced in May 2008 compared to one produced with later corrections in June 2017. Importantly, they do not show a comparison between raw data and corrected data.\nUsing the apparently revelatory finding that the addition of more or higher quality data to a record can change and improve it over time, Breitbart cites co-author D\u2019Aleo\u2019s analysis to suggest that the chart shows past temperatures are intentionally and nefariously biased to be cooler, while recent temperatures are biased to be warmer:\n\nNote how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century. According to meteorologist Joe D\u2019Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend. \u201cNearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments,\u201d [D\u2019Aleo said].\n\nNote how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century. According to meteorologist Joe D\u2019Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend. \u201cNearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments,\u201d [D\u2019Aleo said].\nThis statement implores us to falsely interpret the figure as showing changes to the raw data itself. As previously mentioned, however, this chart (and many similar ones in the \u201cstudy\u201d) shows changes between two versions of corrected data. To make the point Delingpole thinks D\u2019Aleo is making, you would need to show that corrected records of climate relative to raw data make recent temperatures warmer than the raw data, and older records cooler.\nConsidering the most significant adjustment to the data actually increases early 20th century temperatures without doing the same to the post-1950 data, this argument would be a nearly impossible one to make if burdened by facts. Here\u2019s a comparison of a variety of corrected records compared to the raw (uncorrected data), showing that, in fact, the opposite of what D\u2019Aleo is suggesting is the reality:\n\nThe \u201cStudy\u201d Itself\nDelingpole and D\u2019Aleo\u2019s argument, if it accurately represented the data it claimed to be analyzing, might sound reasonable in the absence of literally any other information, but sprinkle just a pinch of context onto it and the interpretation becomes increasingly unpalatable, even with those grains of salt with which Delingpole implores us to take climate science. To dive into that context, some background is needed.\nA bit about these records and how they are generated: Maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s\u00a0NCDC\u00a0and other governmental organizations, these historical records come from myriad disparate, often non-standardized, and difficult to interpret bits of information \u2014 things like ship logs, buoy data, and instrument readings from mercury and digital thermometers. Both historical and modern data are continually added to these databases.\nThis heterogeneity of sources means there are a number of elements that, indeed, need to be adjusted if the record is to be internally consistent. One example comes from gradual changes made to the way in which temperature\u00a0readings have been made since the 1950s, shifting from an evening reading to a morning reading, consequently shifting the raw data to become gradually cooler as morning temperature readings became more common.\nAnother very significant set of corrections that needs to be made stems from multiple\u00a0shifts in how sea temperatures (which are used to calculate ocean surface air temperatures) have been measured on ships. Prior to the 1940s, buckets were thrown off the side of a boat, pulled up, and measured on the spot with a thermometer. Later, people began to use the intake water temperature in ship\u2019s engine rooms. Now, freestanding buoys are typically used, which provide relatively colder readings compared to engine room readings.\n(It was, in fact, an increased understanding of the difference between buoy data and engine room data that caused the most significant change documented by the figure that Breitbart chose to highlight.)\nDocumenting the direction of these changes to the corrections, without explaining them, makes up a bulk of the main argument of the \u201cstudy\u201d. This section, which painstakingly reveals publicly available and well-discussed adjustments to historical climate records reads like a thriller, with the authors taking the reader chronologically step by step, through each mysterious (but also completely documented) correction to these global datasets.\nZeke Hausfather is a scientist at Berkeley Earth, an independent non-governmental research group originally\u00a0skeptical of the correction methods employed in these sorts climate records. He told us these corrections change over time due to increased data and better analytical tools to analyze that data:\n\nWe have dramatically improved our ability to measure the Earth\u2019s climate the last thirty years. And we\u2019ve also launched a lot of efforts to collect all of the global temperature data. [\u2026] Scientists in the eighties and nineties undertook some pretty big efforts to go around and collect all the weather records from all the stations you can find in various parts of the world. And those sort of efforts have continued up through today.\nAnd so, when you look at their, for example, 1980 value from NASA, what that actually came from was about five hundred or so stations on land almost entirely in the northern hemisphere. That\u2019s the best they had at the time so they said this is the best we can do for estimating global temperatures as these are all the stations that we have access to.\nNowadays we actually have an ocean temperature record back to 1850 or so based on data from ships and more recently from buoys. And you know, two-thirds of the earth is ocean, so if you leave oceans out you\u2019re gonna get a fairly incorrect answer.\n\nWe have dramatically improved our ability to measure the Earth\u2019s climate the last thirty years.

The question now is whether the latest versions of GAST data by NOAA, NASA and Hadley are credible for policy analysis, or even climate modeling, purposes.\n\nClearly the historical GAST data adjustments that have been made have been dramatic and invariably have been favorable to Climate Alarmists\u2019 views regarding Global Warming. The question now is whether the latest versions of GAST data by NOAA, NASA and Hadley are credible for policy analysis, or even climate modeling, purposes.\nIgnoring, once again, that adjustments to these records \u2014 relative to the raw data \u2014 decrease apparent warming across the 20th and 21st century, it is also worth noting that Berkeley Earth has painstakingly reviewed this process with their own independent methodology, concluding that the records produced by NCDC and others accurately represent global temperature trends. Hausfather was the lead author on that 2017\u00a0study.\nThe authors of the \u201cstudy\u201d Breitbart cites then attempt to make the point that the raw data from \u201cexceptionally high quality sources\u201d (for which they provide no selection criteria) demonstrate an ambiguously defined \u201cnatural cycle\u201d gradually erased by malicious intent of data adjustments. Almost all of these records are from northern North America and literally all of them are from the Northern Hemisphere. Without acknowledging the geographical limits of their data, the authors conclude:\n\nThus, it seems that beyond any doubt, the U.S. data reflected in the Global Average Surface Temperature data calculation should contain the cyclical patterns shown above.\n\nThus, it seems that beyond any doubt, the U.S. data reflected in the Global Average Surface Temperature data calculation should contain the cyclical patterns shown above.\nAs previously mentioned, data used in the earliest records did indeed show this Northern Hemisphere signal more prominently because \u2014 follow us here \u2014 the vast majority was from land stations in North America. However, when you add the Southern Hemisphere signal \u2014\u00a0a crucial element in the \u201cglobal\u201d concept inherent to global warming \u2014 you are going to dampen the results a bit. This is one of the things that has been happening to that record since its earliest incarnation, says Hausfather:\n\nThe [1980 NASA record is] only based on about five hundred stations almost entirely from the Northern Hemisphere, you do see a bit more warmth in the \u201930\u2019s and \u201940\u2019s. Again [this is] because you\u2019re only looking at Northern Hemisphere lands. But when you add in the oceans, when you add in the Southern Hemisphere, that sort of mid-century warmth doesn\u2019t completely go away, but it becomes much smaller.\n\nThe [1980 NASA record is] only based on about five hundred stations almost entirely from the Northern Hemisphere, you do see a bit more warmth in the \u201930\u2019s and \u201940\u2019s.

But when you add in the oceans, when you add in the Southern Hemisphere, that sort of mid-century warmth doesn\u2019t completely go away, but it becomes much smaller.\nUltimately, the central argument of this study and its representation by Breitbart and others is one based on a willful misreading of data propelled by a study whose academic rigor has been misrepresented. As such, we rank the claim that climate scientists have created global warming entirely through corrections to raw data as false. While these corrections to raw historical data have shifted over time, the cumulative effect of all corrections applied to the raw data has been to reduce apparent global warming over the industrialized period, not the other way around.\n\u201cIf scientists were actually cooking the books,\u201d Hausfather told us \u201cwe\u2019d be cooking them in the wrong directions.\u201d"}, "54": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/investigation-proves-starbucks-beverages-contain-feces/", "title": "\tInvestigation Proves Starbucks Beverages Contain Feces?", "subtitle": "\t\tAn imprecise test that appeared to show Starbucks drinks were contaminated prompted internet hysteria and widespread baseless claims.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["3 July 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/07/ice_coffee_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tAn investigation has proven the presence of feces in Starbucks beverages.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 28 June 2017, the BBC teased an upcoming episode of their program Watchdog, an investigative series into consumer-related issues, with some scary-sounding revelations about coffee shops:\n\nIce from three of the UK\u2019s biggest coffee chains has been found to contain bacteria from faeces, according to a BBC investigation.\nSamples of iced drinks from Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffe Nero contained varying levels of the bacteria, the BBC\u2019s Watchdog found.

[\u2026]\nAt both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples tested contained the bacteria known as faecal coliforms.\nThe news, unlike the bacteria that inspired it, went viral nearly immediately.\u00a0Some people took this BBC report as evidence of a widespread feces problem in Starbucks coffee. Others somehow interpreted this finding as an indictment of Starbucks\u2019s alleged liberal politics. Bizarrely, some purveyors of vitriol tried to connect the report both to Muslims and to Starbucks\u2019s pledge to hire refugees.\u00a0\nImportantly, however, what Watchdog\u00a0found was not\u00a0actually feces or fecal matter, but an extremely broad class of bacteria in 30 percent of the ten samples they took from a single Starbucks in the UK.\nIf you are looking to promote a television show with a viral story, a tried and true method is to perform the test Watchdog used\u00a0\u2014 a fecal coliform assay \u2014 on everyday objects.\u00a0This same approach convinced the internet that beards were poop-infested sanitation risks back in 2015. In response to that fecal hysteria, the Washington Post\u2019s Rachel Feltman had this calming response:\n\nThe problem with this is that bacteria known to associate with poop is not necessarily literal poop. In fact it\u2019s probably not. And saying that something is gross for being covered in bacteria is pretty ridiculous, because anything that exists in our physical realm is definitely going to be covered in bacteria.\nI have bad news for y\u2019all: You\u2019re covered in poo bacteria. COVERED. Look to your left, look to your right. There\u2019s probably poo bacteria on both sides and also in front of you. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really fine.

Indeed, the bacteria identified by a fecal coliform assay is not specific to feces, as a\u00a02006 editorial published by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) pointed out in a piece arguing against using the test as a sole indicator of fecal matter:\n\nHistorically, the definition of fecal coliforms has been based on methods used for their detection. [\u2026] Several genera of bacteria [identified by a fecal coliform assay] are common contaminants of non-fecal sources (e.g., plant materials and pulp or paper mill effluents). Examples include Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter species. Moreover, these bacteria which are false-positive indicators of fecal contamination can grow under appropriate conditions in nonfecal niches such as water, food, and waste.\n\nHistorically, the definition of fecal coliforms has been based on methods used for their detection.

Coli., which the BBC\u2019s Watchdog did not mention identifying (the ASM argues any fecal coliform test should be confirmed with a specific E. Coli test if one wants to demonstrate the presence of feces).\nThe expert the BBC quoted to heighten the fear of Starbucks ice was Tony Lewis, the Head of Policy for the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is described as \u201ca campaigning organisation [that aims] to promote improvements in environmental and public health policy.\u201d While the brief excerpts of him included in the BBC segment sound alarming, his full comments are a bit more reassuring:\n\nIt is important that those of us who enjoy our coffee and particular our iced drinks during the summer, do not panic.

Every single time.\nIn actuality, however, that\u00a0study (which was published in PLOS ONE in 2012, despite being billed as \u201cnew\u201d in 2017) demonstrated for the first time the presence of genetically distinct male cells in the brains of women (who had been examined in autopsy). The existence of male cells in the bodies of females, in general, is not news. As discussed in a PLOS ONE blog\u00a0post describing that 2012 study, their presence is typically ascribed to cells from a male fetus from a prior pregnancy:\n\nThe idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s called microchimerism. [\u2026] Medical chimerism arises after a transfusion or transplant, and it may follow pregnancy.

Such DNA liberated from fetal cells can come from several sources: children, fetuses that never made it to be born, older siblings, or twins. Both son and daughter DNA partake in this \u201cfeto-maternal trafficking,\u201d but female DNA, at the chromosomal level, is harder to detect amid the maternal two X\u2019s.\n\nThe idea of two genetically distinct populations of cells, or their DNA, residing in one individual isn\u2019t new.

The linked study, in fact, does not once mention sexual intercourse as a proposed mechanism. This is as close as you will get from the PLOS ONE paper:\n\nThe most likely source of male [microchimerism, Mc] in female brain is acquisition of fetal Mc from pregnancy with a male fetus. In women without sons, male DNA can also be acquired from an abortion or a miscarriage. The pregnancy history was unknown for all but a few subjects in the current studies, thus male Mc in female brain could not be evaluated according to specific prior pregnancy history. In addition to prior pregnancies, male Mc could be acquired by a female from a recognized or vanished male twin, an older male sibling, or through non-irradiated blood transfusion.\n\nThe most likely source of male [microchimerism, Mc] in female brain is acquisition of fetal Mc from pregnancy with a male fetus.

In addition to prior pregnancies, male Mc could be acquired by a female from a recognized or vanished male twin, an older male sibling, or through non-irradiated blood transfusion.\nAt least that\u2019s what they want you to think, according to YourNewsWire:\n\nThrough the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial. Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain.\nAt this point the scientists didn\u2019t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from.\n\nThrough the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy.

That 2005 paper, which does indeed show the presence of male cells in women who had never given birth to males (or, in some cases, at all), makes only passing reference to the possibility that sexual intercourse alone could contribute male microchirality to women, noting that the issue has yet to be studied:\n\nAnother possibility that has not been investigated is whether male DNA can be detected in a woman\u2019s circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy.\n\nAnother possibility that has not been investigated is whether male DNA can be detected in a woman\u2019s circulation from sexual intercourse without pregnancy.\nThat explanation is the authors\u2019 speculative fourth suggestion (out of four) after three more plausible, and actually researched, theories:\n\nOne potential explanation for male microchimerism could be a nonrecognized (male) miscarriage. [\u2026]\nA second potential source is from a \u201cvanished (male) twin.\u201d A vanished twin is thought to be a relatively common phenomena resulting from spontaneous resorption of one sac or embryo in a twin pregnancy. [\u2026]\nA third possibility is from an older male sibling transferred by the maternal circulation to the fetus of a later pregnancy.

That paper, which was fairly limited in its dataset, makes it clear that the sexual intercourse transfer of male chimerism remains entirely speculative:\n\nA total of 154 girls were studied of which 21 (13.6%) tested positive for male microchimerism. There was a tendency that girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism if their mothers previously had received transfusion, had given birth to a son or had had a spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, the oldest girls were more likely to test positive for male microchimerism.\nHowever, less than half of microchimerism positivity was attributable to these factors. In conclusion, data suggest that male microchimerism in young girls may originate from an older brother either full born or from a discontinued pregnancy or from transfusion during pregnancy. We speculate that sexual intercourse may be important but other sources of male cells likely exist in young girls.\n\nA total of 154 girls were studied of which 21 (13.6%) tested positive for male microchimerism.

The analysis of the findings presented by No Tricks Zone is crude, misinformed, and riddled with errors.\u00a0\nThe basic thesis presented by No Tricks Zone is that these graphs, which are inferred records of things like temperature and precipitation from specific localities through time, show that the climatological changes happening right now are neither dramatic nor man made. The charts highlight times from the somewhat recent pre-industrial past that were either warmer or more dramatically variable then they are now, or show evidence of change attributed to clear natural causes. As Breitbart puts it:\n\nWhat all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming \u2014 aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) \u2014 is a fake artefact.\n\nWhat all these papers argue in their different ways is that the alarmist version of global warming \u2014 aka Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming (CAGW) \u2014 is a fake artefact.\nThis is false. We reached out to many of the authors of the studies included on this list via email to see if they agreed with Breitbart and No Tricks Zone\u2019s analysis. While not everyone we reached out to responded, not a single researcher that we spoke to agreed with Breitbart\u2019s assessment, and most were shocked when we told them that their work was presented as evidence for that claim.\nA representative response came from Paul Mayewski, author of one of the studies included on the No Tricks Zone list and director of the University of Maine\u2019s Climate Change Institute:\n\nThey are absolutely incorrect!!!!\u00a0 Quite the opposite, the paper deals with the impacts of greenhouse gas warming and Antarctic ozone depletion \u2014\u00a0both human caused \u2014 and describes future scenarios.\u00a0 Yet another example of downright lies.\n\nThey are absolutely incorrect!!!!\u00a0 Quite the opposite, the paper deals with the impacts of greenhouse gas warming and Antarctic ozone depletion \u2014\u00a0both human caused \u2014 and describes future scenarios.\u00a0 Yet another example of downright lies.\nOutside of the fact that all of these papers have squiggly lines that represent climatological change through time, they cover a diverse range of highly technical topics and have little in common with each other. In many cases, listed studies are applicable only to a very specific region and were created not to investigate the influence of humans on climate, but to understand how the climate system works in general.\nThis was the case for University of Washington PhD candidate Bradley Markle, whose paper\u00a0(\u201cGlobal Atmospheric Teleconnections During Dansgaard-Oeschger Events\u201d) was also included in the No Tricks Zone:\n\nMy study, and almost all I saw mentioned on the blog post, are studies of climate change in the past. My study investigates connections between different parts of the climate system during climate events that happened over 10,000 years ago. Studying climate change in the past can provide context for recent climate change. However, my study in no way investigates or tries to attribute the causes of recent climate change. It does not deal with human influences on climate at all.\n\nMy study, and almost all I saw mentioned on the blog post, are studies of climate change in the past.

It shows that sea surface temperatures measured over many decades in the Florida Straits are variable, and that variation has been dominated for nearly the past three centuries by a natural oscillation called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. [\u2026] Neither of these findings refutes the role of anthropogenic activity in global climate change.\n\nOur paper presents a 280-year sea surface temperature record based on the ratio of strontium to calcium in corals we sampled in the Dry Tortugas National Park.

This was the case for Claremont McKenna professor Branwen Williams, whose paper\u00a0(\u201cNorth Pacific 20th Century Decadal-Scale Variability Is Unique for the Past 342 Years\u201d) was featured:\n\nI do not agree with this assessment of my work.

The fact that the 1257 Samalas\u00a0eruption altered grape harvests, as one study in the post demonstrated, does not mean humans cannot also alter climate, as the No Trick Zone post implied.\nWe rank the claims made by both Breitbart and No Tricks Zone as false, because they dramatically misrepresent the findings of the scientists who conducted the research and utilize poorly-articulated straw man arguments to further misrepresent the significance of the work of those\u00a0scientists. These studies were local in nature, narrow\u00a0in scope, meant to address how the climate system functioned in the past, and pose no threat to the tenets of anthropogenic climate change.\nGlobal warming, as implied by the name, is a global process. That does not, however, mean that every part of the globe reacts to this process in the same way or at the same rate, or even at all. Richey, the author of the USGS Florida sea-surface temperature record, succinctly described this fallacy:\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is characterized by variable climate responses across the globe. No climate record taken at a single point in space is representative of the global climate.\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is characterized by variable climate responses across the globe.

Thank you\nEqually imprecise is the science involved in the warning. When astronomers discuss cosmic rays, they are almost always referring to high energy protons from outside our solar system that travel at nearly the speed of light and are thought to be ejected from supernovae, the explosion of stars. Sometimes, however, the term also includes high-energy particles from the sun, as described by Caltech astronomer Richard Mewaldt:\n\nCosmic rays are high energy charged particles, originating in outer space, that travel at nearly the speed of light and strike the Earth from all directions. Most cosmic rays are the nuclei of atoms, ranging from the lightest to the heaviest elements in the periodic table. [\u2026] The term \u201ccosmic rays\u201d usually refers to galactic cosmic rays, which originate in sources outside the solar system, distributed throughout our Milky Way galaxy.\nHowever, this term has also come to include other classes of energetic particles in space, including nuclei and electrons accelerated in association with energetic events on the Sun (called solar energetic particles), and particles accelerated in interplanetary space.\n\nCosmic rays are high energy charged particles, originating in outer space, that travel at nearly the speed of light and strike the Earth from all directions.

They do this not because of the health risk they pose to humans (unless you are an astronaut in space) but because of the risk they can pose to electrical grids and devices, as described by NASA:\n\nWhen struck by [\u2026] a coronal mass ejection, our planet\u2019s magnetic fields jostle back and forth. This generates electric currents, radio waves, and accelerates particles. As the atmosphere changes, GPS satellite frequencies that must travel through the ionosphere can be disrupted, resulting in errors of [\u2026] a couple of yards. For airlines, military operations, farmers\u2019 vehicles, and financial transactions that rely on GPS, this interference can prove damaging.\nAnother type of eruption from the sun, called a solar flare, can interfere with shortwave radios. These low frequency radio waves use the ionosphere as a mirror to reflect transmissions around the globe; but during a solar storm, they simply disappear up into the sky\u2014unable to bounce off of an atmosphere so changed by these storms.\n\nWhen struck by [\u2026] a coronal mass ejection, our planet\u2019s magnetic fields jostle back and forth.

The idea that NASA would send out a warning to that effect is belied\u00a0by the fact that not a single warning regarding solar activity from 2010 to 2015 provided any guidance on the placement of your cell phone during such an event. Additionally, the three hour window for avoiding your cell phone is nonsensical, given the fact that such events generally disrupt our magnetic field for a longer period of time.\nIf, however, the warning was referring to a more classical definition of cosmic rays \u2014 the high energy (mostly) protons that come from supernova explosions \u2014\u00a0then the warning is on even shakier scientific ground. That\u2019s because cosmic radiation, which is bouncing around all over the place and deflected by any magnetic field it runs into, is not easily tied to a single origin. In fact scientists only conclusively proved that cosmic rays\u00a0generally come from supernovas in 2013, despite suspicions for a century prior. Cosmic radiation is\u00a0a slowly varying background process that does not necessitate any action on your part.\nThe only conceivable source of an acute cosmic radiation spike would be a stream of particles ejected directly at Earth from a nearby supernova explosion. In addition to the fact that such an event would conceivably offer decades of warning, and therefore make an exclusive scoop by Singapore TV unlikely, there are also no stars both close enough to us and close enough to the end of their life cycle to produce such an event, according to NASA:\n\nAstronomers estimate that, on average, about one or two supernovae explode each century in our galaxy. But for Earth\u2019s ozone layer to experience damage from a supernova, the blast must occur less than 50 light-years away. All of the nearby stars capable of going supernova are much farther than this.\n\nAstronomers estimate that, on average, about one or two supernovae explode each century in our galaxy. But for Earth\u2019s ozone layer to experience damage from a supernova, the blast must occur less than 50 light-years away. All of the nearby stars capable of going supernova are much farther than this.\nIn terms of health effects to humans on the ground, this background cosmic radiation, similar to the solar radiation, poses no immediate harm and cannot be considered a health risk only unless you are chronically exposed to higher radiation levels in polar regions, according to NOAA:\n\nWhen these particles hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with some even reaching the ground. These particles pose little threat to humans and systems on the ground [\u2026]. The Earth\u2019s own magnetic field also works to protect Earth from these particles largely deflecting them away from the equatorial regions but providing little-to-no protection near the polar regions [\u2026]. This constant shower of GCR particles at high latitudes can result in increased radiation exposures for aircrew and passengers at high latitudes and altitudes.\n\nWhen these particles hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with some even reaching the ground.

One commonly shared pairing, floating around the internet since at least 2013, purports to show two covers of Time Magazine: A 1977 issue with the cover story \u201cHow to Survive the Coming Ice Age\u201d and a 2006 \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on global warming with the teaser \u201cBe Worried.

While Time did report run a 24 June 1974 story titled \u201cAnother Ice Age?\u201d, the most notable and by far the most sensationalized version was a 28 April 1975 Newsweek story written by Peter Gwynne, bearing the title \u201cThe Cooling World\u201d:\n\nThe central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions, the earth\u2019s climate seems to be cooling down. Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend [\u2026] but they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the next century. [\u2026]\nClimatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change, or even to allay its effects. They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed, such as melting the arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers, might create problems far greater than those they solve.\n\nThe central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions, the earth\u2019s climate seems to be cooling down.

Here is the account provided in Kranish and Fisher\u2019s biography:\n\nAfter college, after Trump mostly gave up his personal athletic interests, he came to view time spent playing sports as time wasted. Trump believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted. So he didn\u2019t work out.

When he learned that John O\u2019Donnell, one of his top casino executives, was training for an Ironman triathlon, he admonished him, \u201cYou are going to die young because of this.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s view that\u00a0human longevity is\u00a0similar to a non-rechargeable battery is demonstrably false, but it brings up two separate claims that can be investigated scientifically: 1) Do humans have a finite amount of energy? and 2) Does exercising reduce a person\u2019s longevity?\nDo Humans Have A Finite Amount of Energy?\nThe concept of some sort of overarching life-force or \u201cenergy,\u201d while at odds with contemporary science, is a notion that puts Trump in the company of thinkers ranging from antiquity to the early 19th century.\nOne could argue that his battery metaphor blends neatly the Ancient Chinese concept of a life-sustaining energy known as qi with the medieval European concept of humors\u2014 a collection of four substances (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood) which were thought to be in balance when a person was healthy, but which in depletion were the cause of health problems and death.\nFrom a more modern and scientific perspective, Trump\u2019s \u201cfinite\u201d amount of \u201cenergy\u201d notion is reminiscent of the conclusions made by embryologists Jacques Loeb and J. H. Northrop, who in 1917 demonstrated a relationship between temperature and duration of life in fruit flies. These researchers used that result to argue that longevity was controlled by the presence or absence some unknown substance:\n\nThe observations [\u2026] suggest that [the duration of life] is determined by the production of a substance leading to old age and natural death or by the destruction of a substance or substances which normally prevent old age and natural death.\n\nThe observations [\u2026] suggest that [the duration of life] is determined by the production of a substance leading to old age and natural death or by the destruction of a substance or substances which normally prevent old age and natural death.\nWhile modern science increasingly supports the notion of an upper limit on human lifespan, it universally rejects the notion that a fixed amount of \u201cvital energy\u201d is the reason for such a limit.\nDuring the course of the 20th century, scientists hunted for an elusive single factor limiting the human lifespan. They explored such possibilities as (for example) the cumulative effects of cells unable to replicate, as well as some sort of switch in gene expression later in life. These ideas ultimately gave way to the realization that multiple intertwined and complex systems collectively work to produce the upper limits on aging, as a\u00a02003 review\u00a0noted:\n\nThe search for a single cause of aging, such as a single gene or the decline of a key body system, has been replaced by the view of aging as an extremely complex, multifactorial process. Several processes may interact simultaneously and may operate at many levels of functional organization. Similarly, different theories of aging are not mutually exclusive and may adequately describe some or all features of the normal aging process alone or in combination with other theories.\n\nThe search for a single cause of aging, such as a single gene or the decline of a key body system, has been replaced by the view of aging as an extremely complex, multifactorial process. Several processes may interact simultaneously and may operate at many levels of functional organization. Similarly, different theories of aging are not mutually exclusive and may adequately describe some or all features of the normal aging process alone or in combination with other theories.\nSo while a majority of scientists may be open to the idea of a biologically determined limit to human longevity (a finite amount of life, if you will), they would argue it is defined by the accumulation of multiple effects which make it increasingly improbable to survive past a certain age. Few, if any, would argue that this limit comes from an finite, internal \u201cenergy\u201d that has \u201crun out,\u201d however.\nDoes Exercising Reduce a Person\u2019s Longevity?\nThis too, may seem like a question too obvious to even research, but it wasn\u2019t actually until the 1900s that there was hard scientific evidence to suggest a link between longevity and exercise. A landmark 1953 study compared the occurrence of coronary heart disease across occupations of differing levels of physical rigor and found that, counter to Trump\u2019s claims, more physically active professions lived longer lives as a whole:\n\nThe results show that the total incidence of coronary heart-disease is lower in the postmen than in the sedentary grades. Their case-fatality is also lower\u2014a third in the postmen, compared with almost a half in the telephonists, executives, and clerks. Again, therefore, as with the transport workers, the early mortality of the physically active group is substantially less than that of the physically inactive.\n\nThe results show that the total incidence of coronary heart-disease is lower in the postmen than in the sedentary grades.

Again, therefore, as with the transport workers, the early mortality of the physically active group is substantially less than that of the physically inactive.\nThe finding that physically active people tend to live longer is well accepted in the medical community. A 2015 study that included over 600,000 cases concluded that there is both a clear increase in longevity from physical activity, and that it takes an extraordinary amount of exercise to have any negative effect:\n\nWe observed this benefit threshold around 3\u20135 times the recommended leisure-time physical activity minimum, and no excess risk at 10+ times the recommended minimum. These findings are informative for individuals at both ends of the physical activity spectrum: they provide important evidence to inactive individuals by showing that modest amounts of activity provide substantial benefit for postponing mortality, while at the same time reassuring very active individuals of no exercise-associated increase in mortality risk.\n\nWe observed this benefit threshold around 3\u20135 times the recommended leisure-time physical activity minimum, and no excess risk at 10+ times the recommended minimum.

Numerous studies have shown that maintaining a minimal quantity and quality of exercise decreases the risk of cardiovascular mortality, prevents the development of some cancers, lowers the risk of osteoporosis and increases longevity.\n\nExercise can help \u201cadd years to life\u201d, and above all, \u201cadd life to years\u201d, by partially counteracting the effects of aging on physiological functions and preserving functional reserve in elderly.

One was a memo from the North Dakota Department of Health from January 2010, addressed to various local immunization providers. The second was a flyer from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources:\n\nAccording to state and federal hazardous waste management requirements, discarded Thimerosal-preserved vaccines need to be managed as hazardous waste, using the waste code D009 (mercury).\n\nAccording to state and federal hazardous waste management requirements, discarded Thimerosal-preserved vaccines need to be managed as hazardous waste, using the waste code D009 (mercury).\nSpendlove, as well, sent us a link to Missouri State University\u2019s \u201cHazardous Waste & Hazardous Materials Contingency Plan\u201d in defense of the claim that a building need be evacuated if a vaccine vial breaks.

This is a far cry from a building-wide \u201cevacuation\u201d:\n\n\nGet your spill kit\nClean up the spill, look for hidden mercury\nRemove and properly dispose of contaminated items\nKeep the room closed off and air it out for 24 hours after\n\n\nIgnoring the fact that the ethylmercury in thimerosal differs chemically from the elemental mercury in thermometers in significant ways, the relevance of these documents to Kennedy\u2019s claim hinge on the assumption that that the amount of mercury contained in a vaccine is an anyway comparable to the amount of mercury contained in a thermometer. It is not. A small fever thermometer typically\u00a0contains about 610,000 micrograms of mercury. For comparison, a broken 10 dose multi-use flu shot vial would contain about 250 micrograms of mercury \u2014 about 0.04 percent of that in the broken thermometer.\nFor further comparison, this puts the amount of mercury released by a broken 10-dose flu shot vial at an order of magnitude above the amount of mercury found in a three-ounce can of tuna (around 65 micrograms), but\u00a0an order of magnitude below the amount released from a broken CFL light bulb (around 3000-5000 micrograms). Neither events would necessitate evacuating the building, no matter how pungent the tuna may be.\nWe reached out to the CDC to see if these broader guidelines regarding elemental mercury spills apply, at least on a federal level, to a broken vaccine vial containing thimerosal. While acknowledging that state and local regulations may differ, a representative told us that there is no federal requirement that a building be evacuated if a vaccine vial breaks.\nWe are in no way\u00a0arguing that mercury is not a neurotoxic substance, nor are we disputing that it is classified as a hazardous chemical. What we do dispute is that its classification as a hazardous chemical makes its spill a large-scale emergency that necessitates a building wide evacuation, specifically when talking about the amount found in a multi-use flu vaccine vial.\nWe rank this aspect of the claim as false, as the CDC itself disputes the characterization of its own document when used to make the argument and because Mr. Kennedy\u2019s claims rest on comparing two things of completely different scales without providing any relevant context."}, "61": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-nye-gender-chromosomes/", "title": "\tDid Bill Nye Say Gender is Determined \u2018by Your Chromosomes?\u2019", "subtitle": "\t\tAn image purportedly shows a still from an old episode of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\" about gender being \"determined by your chromosomes.\"\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Evon\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["11 May 2017", "27 April 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/04/shutterstock_571411132.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tBill Nye said that gender is determined \"by your chromosomes\" during an episode of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy.\"\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn April 2017, as a debate over the role of science in the United States continued in the wake of the international March for Science, an\u00a0image appeared purportedly showing a still from an old episode of\u00a0Bill Nye the Science Guy along with\u00a0a caption\u00a0stating \u201cGender is determined by your chromosomes\u201d:\n\nThis meme gained popularity shortly after the debut of Nye\u2019s new show,\u00a0Bill Nye Saves the World,\u00a0which featured an episode entitled \u201cThe Sexual Spectrum.\u201d\nHere\u2019s how Nye opened the episode in question \u2014 not by saying that \u201cgender is determined by your chromosomes,\u201d but by discussing that the genetic basis of sex determination through chromosomes is more complicated than usually presented:\nThese are human chromosomes. They contain all the genes you need to make a human person. This one is called an X chromosome and this one down there, that\u2019s a Y chromosome. They are sex chromosomes. Females usually have two Xs and males usually have an X and a Y. But it turns out, about 1 in every 400 pregnancies have a different number of sex chromosomes. Some people only have one sex chromosome, some people have 3, 4 or even 5. For me, I usually feel like I have a lot.\u00a0\nBut using science, we know that sex and every aspect of human sexuality, well, it\u2019s a little complicated \u2026\nThe world is wonderfully diverse.

It was a screenshot pulled from a\u00a0fifth-season episode of\u00a0Bill Nye the Science Guy,\u00a0entitled \u201cGenes.\u201d The clip, which can be glimpsed starting at the 9:05 mark of the following video, shows Nye explaining how humans generally have 23 pairs of chromosomes: \nOur genes are stored in parts of our cells called chromosomes. They look like this. Chromosomes contain all of the genetic information, all of the instructions you need to make a person. Now humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46.\nOur genes are stored in parts of our cells called chromosomes. They look like this. Chromosomes contain all of the genetic information, all of the instructions you need to make a person. Now humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46.\nShortly after this meme went viral and was subsequently debunked, Nye\u2019s detractors latched onto a 20-year-old clip from Bill Nye the Science Guy which featured actress Amy Broder saying that there were \u201conly two possibilities\u201d when it comes to gender: \u201cYou\u2019re either X and X. Girl. Or X and Y. Boy. The chance of becoming either a boy or a girl is always 1 in 2.\u201d\nThis clip came from \u201cProbabilities,\u201d an episode from the show\u2019s fourth season. The scene can be glimpsed at the 7:43 mark of the following video:\nSo what changed? Did Bill Nye alter his scientific conclusions to appease a liberal audience? Was he paid off to say that gender was a spectrum as some have alleged?\u00a0\nNye may have provided some insight into this quandary in 2017 during \u201cThe Sexual Spectrum\u201d episode of Bill Nye Saves the World. Before bringing out the \u201cAbacus of Sex,\u201d a tool used by Nye to describe four aspects of sexuality, sex, gender, expression, and attraction, Nye said that his understanding of sexuality, as well as the world\u2019s, was still evolving:\n\u201cIf you\u2019re like me, and I know I am, you\u2019re still learning about this field of science. We used to think that there were just two settings. Male and female.

We used to think that there were just two settings. Male and female.

X and a Y chromosome for males. Two Xs for females. But we see more combinations than that in real life \u2026\nWe have to listen to the science.

Although a character on Bill Nye the Science Guy may have said that there were \u201conly two possibilities\u201d when it comes to gender, that episode first aired more than 20 years ago in 1996. Nye\u2019s understanding of sex and gender, as well as the world\u2019s, has grown since then.\nThis clip was subjected to yet another rumor in May 2017, when outlets such as the Daily Wire published articles claiming that the Internet streaming giant had edited an old episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy to omit a segment about gender. A spokesperson for Netflix told us in an e-mail that \u201cNetflix did not edit Bill Nye the Science Guy.

Instead, it aims to document the numerous and brazenly misleading scientific claims made about this new \u201csuperfuel\u201d.\u00a0\nWhat Moors refers to as OBL is lithium brine (found in salt lakes that have\u00a0high concentrations of lithium) or their geologic deposits in the form of salts like lithium carbonate or lithium chloride. These raw materials are used to make lithium-ion batteries, common in cell phones and increasingly in demand for electric cars. A\u00a0post\u00a0at Stock Gumshoe makes a detailed case for concluding OBL is actually this resource, and the stated locations of the deposits (the Andes and Nevada) as well as Moors\u2019 discussion of electric automobile industry further support that conclusion.\nThe reason the ad uses the term OBL (allegedly an acronym for the Spanish translation of \u201cwhite gold,\u201d \u201coro blanco\u201d), instead of the scientifically accurate term lithium carbonate, is likely due to the fact that saying \u201clithium demand will rise in the future as electric cars become more popular\u201d is far from a hot take, as evidenced by a fairly similar take published in Forbes nearly a decade ago:\n\nSince a vehicle battery requires a hundred times as much lithium carbonate as its laptop equivalent, the green-car revolution could make lithium one of the planet\u2019s most strategic commodities. The rush is on to find and develop new sources of it, a race that has mining companies scouring the globe\u2019s remotest corners, from the high-altitude deserts of Chile and Bolivia to the wilds of northern Tibet.\n\nSince a vehicle battery requires a hundred times as much lithium carbonate as its laptop equivalent, the green-car revolution could make lithium one of the planet\u2019s most strategic commodities.

The explanation Moors gives for OBL\u2019s superior performance sounds nice and neat, but it stems from a comparison that makes apples and oranges look like identical twins:\n\nSo you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201chow is this even possible?\u201d I\u2019ll give you two reasons. One of them is simple science. And the other sounds like magic. First off, this crystal fuel can withstand extreme temperatures. Consider gasoline. It might start boiling at 104 degrees Fahrenheit. When it does, some amounts will evaporate. That\u2019s potential fuel that is vanishing into thin air. OBL doesn\u2019t have this problem. It doesn\u2019t boil until it hits 2,457 degrees Fahrenheit. [\u2026]\nNow, the second reason. [\u2026] It\u2019s [sic] \u201cenergy density\u201d is unrivaled.\n\nSo you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201chow is this even possible?\u201d I\u2019ll give you two reasons.

[\u2026]\nNow, the second reason. [\u2026] It\u2019s [sic] \u201cenergy density\u201d is unrivaled.\nGasoline powers a car through the energy created by\u00a0combustion (which is, incidentally, why you wouldn\u2019t want it to withstand extremely high temperatures), whereas a lithium-ion battery creates its power from the chemical energy generated by the movement of lithium ions.\nThis renders the first argument irrelevant, even if you ignore the fact that you can\u2019t\u00a0\u201cfill\u201d a car with the raw precursor component of a lithium-ion battery, and the fact that that a battery requires A) other chemicals and B) the regular input of energy to reset that chemical system (i.e. the part where you charge it every 100-300 miles).\nThe second argument \u2014\u00a0that lithium batteries\u00a0are more energy dense than gasoline \u2014 can more accurately be described as a bald-faced lie. The implication that a lithium-ion battery\u2019s energy density, a quantifiable thermodynamic quality inherent to any substance,\u00a0is greater than that of gasoline is not only false, it is the defining scientific hurdle to making electric cars a viable economic solution, as discussed in a post by the American Physical Society:\n\nStored energy in fuel is considerable: gasoline is the champion at 47.5 MJ/kg and 34.6 MJ/liter; the gasoline in a fully fueled car has the same energy content as a thousand sticks of dynamite. A lithium-ion battery pack has about 0.3 MJ/kg and about 0.4 MJ/liter (Chevy VOLT). Gasoline thus has about 100 times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.\n\nStored energy in fuel is considerable: gasoline is the champion at 47.5 MJ/kg and 34.6 MJ/liter; the gasoline in a fully fueled car has the same energy content as a thousand sticks of dynamite.

Gasoline thus has about 100 times the energy density of a lithium-ion battery.\nThese factual problems are masked by Moors\u2019 frequent sidetracks into\u00a0technically valid scientific statements that are both utterly irrelevant and diversionary, including this gem:\n\nAstrophysicists have observed OBL being produced by dwarf stars and cosmic rays colliding. The explosion is so intense, it causes the stars to burn up to 100,000 times brighter than they did before. It also sets off a Galactic process known as stellar nucleosynthesis, which gives birth to this superfuel.\n\nAstrophysicists have observed OBL being produced by dwarf stars and cosmic rays colliding. The explosion is so intense, it causes the stars to burn up to 100,000 times brighter than they did before. It also sets off a Galactic process known as stellar nucleosynthesis, which gives birth to this superfuel.\nStellar nucleosynthesis, the process that powers stars through nuclear reactions, is responsible for the formation of pretty much all elements heavier than helium in our universe, making this statement broadly true for nearly everything in the universe \u2014 a concept made famous by Carl Sagan\u2019s memorable quote, \u201cWe are made of star stuff,\u201d in the original run of Cosmos.  The statement makes you feel like you could power your car with the force of a stellar explosion, but it is, in reality, a meaningless letdown.\nThis technique is a common one for Moors.

Excluding the fact that multiple companies have ownership of different regions of the general deposit to which Moors refers (and that five companies dominate this market globally), the Nevada deposits are speculative and not necessarily viable, as discussed in a feature about the future of the American lithium market in Fortune:\n\nPure Energy Minerals [one company with an interest in the Nevada deposits] is trying to determine, and prove with its samples and testing, that the lithium brine in Clayton Valley is as high quality and in abundance as the small four-person team thinks it is. The company estimates that there are 816,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent underneath their land claims that stretch over 9,000 acres, or 14 square miles, of the basin. Lithium carbonate is a lithium compound and it\u2019s a standard way that lithium supplies are measured.\nIn comparison, the global reserves of lithium carbonate equivalent\u2014which is the amount that can be economically mined right now\u2014is estimated to be about 75 million metric tons, according to the United States Geological Survey. The U.S. can only claim about 203,000 metric tons of those reserves right now.\n\nPure Energy Minerals [one company with an interest in the Nevada deposits] is trying to determine, and prove with its samples and testing, that the lithium brine in Clayton Valley is as high quality and in abundance as the small four-person team thinks it is.

Never.\u201d\nThe piece attempted to make the argument that, due to germs released to the air when a toilet is flushed combined with superior germ prevention abilities of toilet seats, there would be more germs on the paper\u00a0barrier than on the seat itself:\n\nFor a long time, people thought the seats were covered in germs and nasties and people could pick up all kinds of horrible gastrointestinal infections from them. But given their special shape and their particularly smooth surfaces, toilet seats actually prevent bacteria from settling on them. In addition, germs cannot multiply on bare skin, so mere contact with the toilet seat is not so bad after all. Toilet paper, on the other hand, is a completely different story.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that (almost) no one puts the toilet lid down after using and flushing the toilet.\u00a0 As a result, all those germs spread around the room and also on the toilet paper. And contrary to the toilet seat, toilet paper is an ideal place for germs to gather. Its surface makes it easy for bacteria to settle on. It is precisely this germ-infested toilet paper that you would reach out to grab with your hands and then, unconsciously, you would touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.\n\nFor a long time, people thought the seats were covered in germs and nasties and people could pick up all kinds of horrible gastrointestinal infections from them.

It is precisely this germ-infested toilet paper that you would reach out to grab with your hands and then, unconsciously, you would touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.\nThere is a glaring logical fallacy in this argument that essentially makes debunking the science behind it unnecessary: Presumably, you will still be touching that same toilet paper with your hands when you reach for it to wipe; as well, you might \u201cunconsciously\u2026 touch your face, allowing the bacteria the easiest passageway into your body.\u201d\nWe are not going to take that easy route out, though, because the science presented is not only illogical, it is factually inaccurate. The article\u2019s central argument is that there is unlikely to be any appreciable amount of bacteria on the seat itself and that there would be, comparatively speaking, more on the toilet paper.\nThese are actually questions scientists have addressed on multiple occasions in peer-reviewed journals. For example, a\u00a01975 study (\u201cMicrobiological Hazards of Household Toilets\u201d) used\u00a0both laboratory work and \u201cfieldwork\u201d in public bathrooms to reveal\u00a0that, while flushing a toilet does allow bacteria and viruses to \u201cremain airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the bathroom\u201d, the samples most consistently showing the most bacteria was the seats of the toilet, not the walls or other surfaces near it.\nA study published in 2005, using its own experimental data as well as a review of literature on the topic, reached a similar conclusion:\n\nEpidemiological studies from recurrent outbreaks of norovirus infection in successive cohorts of guests in hotels and on cruise ships [\u2026] suggests spread from infected persons after vomiting by settling of aerosol particles onto surfaces which are then touched by hands. In addition, these studies suggested that splashing or aerosol generation during toilet flushing may spread virus particles onto contact surfaces such as the toilet seat or flush handle.\nCombined with our experimental data we believe that the potential spread of enteric disease by contact with surfaces in bathrooms harbouring pathogens cannot be ignored and must be regarded as a serious infection risk.\n\nEpidemiological studies from recurrent outbreaks of norovirus infection in successive cohorts of guests in hotels and on cruise ships [\u2026] suggests spread from infected persons after vomiting by settling of aerosol particles onto surfaces which are then touched by hands.

To that point, experiments have demonstrated that pathogens on non-porous surfaces (such as the toilet seat) are more easily transferred to the skin than from porous ones (such as toilet paper).\nThe post also makes the argument that putting the seat cover down reduces the risks of introducing pathogens to the air and, as a result, bathroom surface; as we now know, this would certainly increase the risk of transferring pathogens to your hands as well. But this claim, as well, flies in the face of the experimental results presented in that 2005 study:\n\nExperiments were carried out to establish the dynamics of aerosol formation and surface contamination after seeding the toilet with [both a bacterial and viral pathogen]. Closing the toilet lid had little effect in reducing the number of bacteria released into the air [\u2026]. The highest level of surface contamination was closest to the aerosol source, at the toilet seat level [\u2026].\n\nExperiments were carried out to establish the dynamics of aerosol formation and surface contamination after seeding the toilet with [both a bacterial and viral pathogen].

Logically speaking, it is also fairly irrelevant. The mechanism that is discussed throughout the Hefty.co post is not an infection on the skin, but transfer to the\u00a0mouth from the\u00a0hands.\nAs you need only a small number of pathogens to enter your gastrointestinal tract, and because many pathogens can survive on a variety of\u00a0surfaces for extended periods of time, the purported lack of \u201cmultiplication\u201d on your skin\u00a0is no protection from infection if there should be any contact between your hand and your buttocks (or anything else your buttocks may have come in contact with).\nUltimately, what you put between yourself and the toilet seat is between you and your toilet, but we rate these claims as false because a.) you are not reducing risk of spreading germs by failing to put down\u00a0toilet paper, and b.) you are, likewise, certainly not increasing the risk by putting down toilet paper. The risk of germs is omnipresent, and it should, if anything, highlight the importance of washing your hands after using the bathroom."}, "65": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bill-gates-vaccinations-depopulation/", "title": "\tDid Bill Gates \u2018Admit\u2019 Vaccinations Are Designed So Governments Can \u2018Depopulate\u2019 the World?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe computer magnate believes that vaccines can be used to reduce childhood mortality and ultimately reduce population growth through associated social changes, not as an agent of death.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["10 March 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/03/bill_gates_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tBill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 21 January 2016, dubious news and conspiracy theory site Your News Wire (now NewsPunch) published an article with the headline \u201cBill Gates Admits \u2018Vaccines Are Best Way to Depopulate\u2019\u201d. The article opened with a damning assertion: \u201cBill Gates has openly admitted that vaccinations are designed so that governments can depopulate the world.\u201d\nTo support this claim, the site presented a February 2011 video clip of Bill Gates being interviewed by CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta about his foundation\u2019s vaccination efforts:\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make it \u201cthe year of the vaccines.\u201d What does that mean exactly?\nBill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out to all the children who need them \u2026 We only need about six or seven more \u2014 and then you would have all the tools to reduce childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything \u2014 the stability, the environment \u2014 benefits from that.\nDr. Sanjay Gupta: Ten billion dollars over the next 10 years to make it \u201cthe year of the vaccines.\u201d What does that mean exactly?\nBill Gates: Over this decade, we believe unbelievable progress can be made, in both inventing new vaccines and making sure they get out to all the children who need them \u2026 We only need about six or seven more \u2014 and then you would have all the tools to reduce childhood death, reduce population growth, and everything \u2014 the stability, the environment \u2014 benefits from that.\nTo make sure the point was not lost on the reader, Your News Wire repeated the \u201creduce population growth\u201d emphasized above numerous times at a variety of different playback speeds, as if to suggest this were a slip of the tongue revealing some nefarious secret.

You will also casually hear him promoting HEALTH CARE and REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, to accomplish that same goal.\nIn the second excerpt you will hear Gates again confirming his profound affection for vaccines\nThe damming moment, according to Your News Wire was the following statement from Gates: \u201cFirst, we\u2019ve got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That\u2019s headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent \u2026\u201d\nThe suggestion, hinted at by both of these clips and argued later in the article, was that Gates knows vaccines are dangerous \u2014 and he is using this information to kill children in the developing world to stem population growth. In reality, however, Gates\u2019 statements regarding vaccines and population growth were neither an accidental slip nor a nefarious admission of plans for a new world order.\nAs discussed in a 21 November 2011 Forbes cover story profiling the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reducing population growth has always been integral to their stated mission of \u201cimproving people\u2019s health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty\u201d:\nIn 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health \u2026 they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources \u00f7 people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control.\nIn 1997, when he and Melinda first ventured into public health \u2026 they focused on birth control, funding a Johns Hopkins effort to use computers to help women in the developing world learn about contraception. The logic was crisp and Bill Gates-friendly. Health = resources \u00f7 people. And since resources, as Gates noted, are relatively fixed, the answer lay in population control.\nAs further discussed in this piece, Gates later came to the conclusion that birth control was not the best approach to achieve the goal of slower population growth, instead realizing that \u2014 counterintuitively \u2014 a reduction in childhood mortality was the best way to limit population growth:\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls\u2014specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people\u2014the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. \u201cIt goes against common sense,\u201d Gates says. Most parents don\u2019t choose to have eight children because they want to have big families, it turns out, but because they know many of their children will die.\n\u201cIf a mother and father know their child is going to live to adulthood, they start to naturally reduce their population size,\u201d\u2008says Melinda.\nIn society after society, he saw, when the mortality rate falls\u2014specifically, below 10 deaths per 1,000 people\u2014the birth rate follows, and population growth stabilizes. \u201cIt goes against common sense,\u201d Gates says.

As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children.\nA surprising but critical fact we learned was that reducing the number of deaths actually reduces population growth \u2026 Contrary to the Malthusian view that population will grow to the limit of however many kids can be fed, in fact parents choose to have enough kids to give them a high chance that several will survive to support them as they grow old. As the number of kids who survive to adulthood goes up, parents can achieve this goal without having as many children.\nIn other words, Gates is not interested in using vaccines to reduce the population by using them as an agent of death or a tool to sterilize unsuspecting masses. Rather, Gates is interested in keeping more children alive in order to reduce the need for parents to have more children, thus limiting the overall population growth rate.\nAs evidenced in a 2014 paper published in Science that attempted to calculate future population growth, not everyone is convinced childhood mortality is the smoking gun to quell population growth:\nAmong the most robust empirical findings in the literature on fertility transitions are that higher contraceptive use and higher female education are associated with faster fertility decline. These suggest that the projected rapid population growth could be moderated by greater investments in family planning programs to satisfy the unmet need for contraception and in girls\u2019 education.\nAmong the most robust empirical findings in the literature on fertility transitions are that higher contraceptive use and higher female education are associated with faster fertility decline. These suggest that the projected rapid population growth could be moderated by greater investments in family planning programs to satisfy the unmet need for contraception and in girls\u2019 education.\nBut Gates\u2019 view on childhood mortality contribution to population growth is increasingly discussed in the scientific literature and is still subject to debate. What is not up to debate are the intentions of the Bill and Melinda Gate\u2019s Foundation with regard to vaccines and population growth, as articulated by Bill and Melinda Gates in their Foundation\u2019s 2017 Annual Letter:\nMelinda: Saving children\u2019s lives is the goal that launched our global work. It\u2019s an end in itself. But then we learned it has all these other benefits as well. If parents believe their children will survive \u2014 and if they have the power to time and space their pregnancies \u2014 they choose to have fewer children.\nBill: When a mother can choose how many children to have, her children are healthier, they\u2019re better nourished, their mental capacities are higher \u2014 and parents have more time and money to spend on each child\u2019s health and schooling.

Two thousand questionnaires concerning the handedness of the deceased family member were sent to the listed next of kin, which resulted in 987 usable cases (495 male subjects and 492 female subjects).

Historical records support this argument, presented in the book Language Lateralization and Psychosis:\n\nAbout 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded \u2026 It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so. Detailed data only began to become available for those born in the nineteenth century, and there is growing evidence that the rate of left-handedness fell precipitously during the Victorian period, reaching a nadir of about 3% in about 1895 or so, and then rising quite quickly until an asymptote is reached for those born after about 1945 to 1950, with 11% to 12% of men and 9% to 10% of women typically being left-handed in Western countries.\n\n\nAbout 90% of people are right-handed and 10% are lefthanded \u2026 It is probable that about 8% to 10% of the population has been left-handed for at least the past 200 000 years or so.

A good explanation of the result of such a bias was provided in a series of letters to the editor regarding the NEJM study, notably the following from epidemiologist Kenneth Rothman:\n\nComparing mean ages at death is a classic fallacy, as it involves comparing only the numerators of rates, rather than the rates themselves. Using the same approach as Halpern and Coren, one would conclude that nursery school is more dangerous than paratrooper training, since the mean age at death of children in nursery school is much lower than that of paratrooper trainees.\n\n\nComparing mean ages at death is a classic fallacy, as it involves comparing only the numerators of rates, rather than the rates themselves.

It works by bouncing electromagnetic waves of a specific frequency range called terahertz radiation, which is described in a 2007 report on its potential for security applications:\n\nTerahertz (THz) waves, or submillimeter/far-infrared waves, refer to electromagnetic radiation in the frequency interval from 0.1 to 10 THz. They occupy a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the mid-infrared and microwave bands.\n\nTerahertz (THz) waves, or submillimeter/far-infrared waves, refer to electromagnetic radiation in the frequency interval from 0.1 to 10 THz. They occupy a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the mid-infrared and microwave bands.\nTo support her argument that these devices are dangerous, she links to a 2009 MIT Technology Review article discussing a study (the \u201cLos Alamos study\u201d) that sought to address interactions between the natural frequencies present in the hydrogen bonds of DNA and a THz field:\n\nAt first glance, it\u2019s easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging. Terahertz photons are not energetic enough to break chemical bonds or ionise atoms or molecules, the chief reasons why higher energy photons such as x-rays and UV rays are so bad for us.

In their study, Alexandrov and colleagues wanted to investigate the possibility that terahertz radiation, because it is similar in frequencies of energy holding hydrogen bonds together, could possibly interact in a way so as to amplify each other\u2019s signals to the point where it could break chemical bonds:\n\nThe energy of [terahertz] radiation is too low to directly disrupt any chemical bonds or cause electronic transitions. Only a resonance-type interaction might lead to an appreciable, biological effect. In biomolecules such interactions are possible through the ubiquitous hydrogen bonds that have energies in the THz range.\n\nThe energy of [terahertz] radiation is too low to directly disrupt any chemical bonds or cause electronic transitions. Only a resonance-type interaction might lead to an appreciable, biological effect.

In the presence of weak perturbations e.g. thermal fluctuations, small amplitude response occurs (at half the driving frequency) either in a spatially uniform manner or, at higher frequencies, in an unusual spatially dimerized form. In the latter case, neighboring base pairs oscillate in an out-of-phase fashion. However, large localized openings (bubbles) in the DNA double strand can only occur via a nonlinear mechanism requiring a spatial perturbation above a certain amplitude threshold that is determined by the intensity and the frequency of the THz field.\n\nWe have found that a THz field may cause dynamical separations of the DNA double strand.

According to the actual authors of the paper, however, their research holds no relevance to airport scanners. In an e-mail, Alexandrov (the lead author of the \u201cLos Alamos\u201d study), told us:\n\nOur project is still at the level of exploratory basic research, and we have drawn no connections to full-body scanners.\n\nOur project is still at the level of exploratory basic research, and we have drawn no connections to full-body scanners.\nCo-author Anny Usheva reiterated this point via email as well:\n\nWe never investigated if THz cleaves DNA.

It has never been investigated how scanners alter DNA and the biological THz effect in the time frames that are relevant to the scanning procedures.\nIndeed, she clarified that her research (on which she said they have made progress but are held up due to a lack of funding) aims to use THz radiation over much longer intervals of time to \u201creprogram\u201d cells for regenerative medicine:\n\nThe work is collaborative with my lab at Harvard Medical School/presently at Brown and Los Alamos. We do the laser/THz part at Los Alamos. As a corresponding author of these publications,\u00a0 I am confident to say that there is a biological effect after 8 hours of continuous broad band (0.1-10 THz) exposure. Our goal at the moment is to achieve massive and fast reprogramming of cells (outside of the body) for the needs of the regenerative medicine.\n\nThe work is collaborative with my lab at Harvard Medical School/presently at Brown and Los Alamos.

The federally funded research and development center Pacific Northwest Laboratories highlights\u00a0the actual time frame on a page describing the development of the TSA\u2019s scanners:\n\nScans [are] completed in 1-2 seconds using a two-array system to keep people moving through security check points quickly.\n\nScans [are] completed in 1-2 seconds using a two-array system to keep people moving through security check points quickly.\nThat same website, conveniently, lists all of the patents associated with the TSA\u2019s millimeter wave technology. While there are\u00a0several frequency ranges associated with the methodologies patented to analyze millimeter data, the three patents that describe the actual device employed by TSA makes it clear that only a small fraction of the terahertz range is utilized, as described in the most recent patent filing:\n\nA holographic apparatus for near real-time imaging of a target, said apparatus utilizing millimeter wave radiation having a plurality of frequencies from about 1 to about 110 GHz.\n\nA holographic apparatus for near real-time imaging of a target, said apparatus utilizing millimeter wave radiation having a plurality of frequencies from about 1 to about 110 GHz.\nExpressed in GHz, the broadband exposure (i.e. multiple wavelengths at the same time) Usheva investigated was 100 to 10,000 GHz, a range that barely overlaps with with the TSA\u2019s stated range of 1 to 110 GHz, and a far cry from \u201cbroad band\u201d terahertz radiation.\nThe authors of the study themselves refute the claims made by the \u201cCollective Evolution\u201d post and the study itself is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the technology utilized by airport scanners.

A hundred years ago, peanut allergies were unheard of, yet today, as many as 2 million U.S. children are allergic to them. What changed? The flu shot.\nThough articles and individuals attempting to make this link propose a variety of mechanisms for the ways in which an inoculation could contribute to the development of peanut allergies, each relies on the false premise that vaccines (childhood and/or influenza) contain undisclosed traces of peanut oil.\nThe most common narrative found online is that peanut oil is used as what is known as an adjuvant (a chemical that increases the body\u2019s immune response to an inoculation) but loopholes in the legal system allow this information to remain undisclosed.\nThis assertion appears to have its roots in the 2011 book The Peanut Allergy Epidemic by Heather Fraser, which has a section about the potential presence of peanut oil adjuvants in vaccines. Fraser attempts to argue that some kinds of adjuvants in injections (not specifically childhood vaccines) may have, through poorly understood mechanisms, sensitized children to peanut and other allergies. This specific chapter (and the evidence it cites) appears to be the basis for a number peanut oil claims on numerous anti\u2013vaccine websites.\nThe web site VaccineInformationNetwork.com\u00a0summarizes that narrative in a way that is representative of many posts:\n\nMany different substances have been used as adjuvants over the last 100 years, and the scientists have been constantly on the lookout for more dangerous substances which produce extreme immune reactions in the human body, until one day they stumbled upon a substance that delivered the kind of deadly reaction they were looking for: Peanuts.\nPeanuts were first used as an adjuvant in vaccines in the mid-60s. We know this because the startling admission was made in the New York Times on 18 Sep 1964, where the author described how a newly patented ingredient including peanut oil was being added to the flu vaccine as an adjuvant in order to \u2018enhance the vaccines strength\u2019. Peanut oil became the model for subsequent vaccines, and by the 1980s it had become the preferred adjuvant for the manufacturers.\nToday, peanut oil is a common trade secret ingredient used in vaccine adjuvants.

[\u2026]\nThe current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine re\u00adports favorably on studies in which 880 persons received killed influenza virus in Adju\u00advant 65.\nThis article, however, in no way demonstrates that vaccines commonly contained peanut-oil adjuvants in the 1960s; In fact, it makes it clear that they were not even approved for public use in the United States, explicitly stating \u201cthe new vaccine is still under study and is not yet licensed for general use.\u201d\nThis kind of bait-and-switch is also applied to another New York Times article from 1966. Here, crucially, Fraser says\u00a0that in 1966, \u201cMerck introduced this novel peanut oil additive to the public in a flu vaccine\u201d, implying the product was approved for public use. The only problem is the story she cited concerns a conference presentation by the same researchers in the 1964 study, and it once again makes it clear that it is\u00a0not\u00a0a publicly available concoction, but instead still undergoing testing:\n\nStudies of an additive to an influenza vaccine show that it increases the potency and duration of the vaccine\u2019s protective effect. This was reported today at an international conference on vaccines here that is sponsored by the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization.\nThe additive \u2014 called an adjuvant \u2014 has been tested on 15,000 adults and children. To date, the studies suggest that use of the adjuvant produces a high level of immunity that lasts for several years. Ordinarily, it is believed that flu vaccine produced from a killed virus produces an immunity that is likely to last only one season.\n\nStudies of an additive to an influenza vaccine show that it increases the potency and duration of the vaccine\u2019s protective effect.

Ordinarily, it is believed that flu vaccine produced from a killed virus produces an immunity that is likely to last only one season.\nWhen asked for clarification, Fraser told us via email that she did not intend to suggest that Adjuvant 65 was ever used in American vaccines:\n\nAdjuvant 65-4 [the specific formulation tested then] was never licensed for use in the US. It was used in vaccines in clinical trials, some large scale over a period of at least 10 years. I did not mean to suggest that this adjuvant was used outside of clinical trials in the US.\n\nAdjuvant 65-4 [the specific formulation tested then] was never licensed for use in the US.

I did not mean to suggest that this adjuvant was used outside of clinical trials in the US.\nIntent or not, it appears likely that many anti-vaccine websites have taken these two citations as proof that Adjuvant 65, or some peanut oil containing progeny, is and remains a commonly used ingredient in vaccines. In reality, however, Adjuvant 65 was never approved for use in the United States and many other countries due to concerns about its toxicity. No human vaccines presently contain the compound.\nPeanut Oil \u201cBecame a Model\u201d for Subsequent Adjuvants in Vaccines \u2014 False\nThis wording is vague as it does not define what \u201cbecame a model\u201d actually means. One thing it does not mean, however, is that the failure of Adjuvant 65 resulted in a number of other more successful and widely used peanut based vaccine adjuvants, as there has not been a single such product licensed for use in human vaccines.\nA more accurate narrative concerning vegetable oil based adjuvants and the relative importance of Adjuvant 65 in medical history can be found in a 1993 review of the topic, which describes the efforts to create vegetable oil adjuvants (which can be metabolized by the body) as a replacement for mineral oil adjuvants (which, because they cannot, lead to health concerns):\n\nVarious kinds of emulsions with different oil samples have been evaluated in a search for a stable, non-toxic and better adjuvant. As an alternative to mineral oil emulsion adjuvants, [the research group associated with Merck] designed a vegetable oil adjuvant, \u2018Adjuvant 65\u2019, consisting of 86% peanut oil, 10% Arlacel A [\u2026] as emulsifier and 4% aluminium monostearate as stabilizer [\u2026].\nWhen tried in humans, this adjuvant appeared to be safe and potent but with less adjuvanticity than [the most common mineral oil adjuvant]. Although Adjuvant 65 was licensed for general use in one country, its use was discontinued due to reactogenicity for man [\u2026]\nDespite the absence of tumour formation in [\u2026] several thousand persons inoculated with Adjuvant 65 influenza vaccine followed for 10 years, further work on these adjuvants of vegetable oil with Arlacel A slowed down or even stopped when it was shown in one report that Arlacel A [might be carcinogenic in one strain of lab mice]. [\u2026]\n[One research group] developed an adjuvant with sesame oil double emulsion without Arlacel A which could be metabolized. This preparation had a good adjuvant effect on the antibody response of mice. Another preparation containing highly refined peanut oil emulsified in aqueous arbovirus vaccine with glycerol and lecithin increased antibody production and induced protective immunity in several experimental animals. Unlike Arlacel A, glycerol and lecithin are readily metabolized normal host constituents. This formula of peanut oil, glycerol and lecithin has been described as relatively non-reactogenic in tissues. However [as of 1993], there is still no oil emulsion adjuvant which may be used in humans. \n\nVarious kinds of emulsions with different oil samples have been evaluated in a search for a stable, non-toxic and better adjuvant.

However [as of 1993], there is still no oil emulsion adjuvant which may be used in humans. \nIn her book, Fraser cites a single research paper testing a peanut-oil based adjuvant in a variety of animal models, as well as a handful of patent applications, to defend the claim that it was \u201ca model\u201d for other adjuvants at the time.\nWhile it is unclear what became of that particular adjuvant in that study, no peanut-oil adjuvant has ever been licensed for use in American vaccines, meaning it likely didn\u2019t go anywhere. At least one of the patents Fraser cites, incidentally, certainly didn\u2019t go anywhere \u2014 it is currently listed as expired\u00a0because of lack of payment for administrative fees. Far from being a model for new adjuvants, peanut oil could more accurately be described as a dead end.\nBy the 1980s Peanut Oil Was the Preferred Adjuvant for Vaccines \u2014 False\nThis claim, incidentally, is not made in Fraser\u2019s book, but is included on the VaccineInformationNetwork.com post, and may stem from a misreading of her statement that the inclusion of peanut oil in vaccine adjuvant patents became \u201ccommon practice\u201d.\nRegardless of the relative meaninglessness of the term \u201ccommon practice\u201d in this context (or the irrelevance of a patent application to a larger discussion of epidemiological trends) claiming that peanut oil was a preferred adjuvant for vaccines by the 1980s is about as \u201calternative fact\u201d as they come. As discussed above, efforts to develop vegetable oil based adjuvants essentially stopped in the late 1970s. There are, currently, only two types of adjuvants approved for U.S. use: aluminum salts and a single,\u00a0animal-derived oil emulsion used only in the Cervarix vaccine and only since 2009.\nFar from being the preferred adjuvant beginning in the 1980s, peanut oil adjuvants have never been licensed for human use in US vaccines, and are currently not licensed for human vaccine use anywhere else.\nThere Are Loopholes That Make it Legal for Vaccine Manufacturers to Hide the Presence of Peanut Oil from the Public \u2014 False\nIn case the complete and total lack of evidence supporting the claim that peanut oil can be found in vaccines convinced you that they were peanut free, anti-vaccine advocates also throw in a burden-of-proof logical fallacy to contend with: that pharmaceutical companies are doing it secretly and there is literally no way to know for sure.\nA number of websites make the argument that there are legal loopholes that allow pharmaceutical companies to \u201cget away\u201d with putting peanut oil in vaccines. Fraser makes that argument in her book, too, but without any supporting evidence:\n\nHowever, with the sharp rise in lawsuits against vaccine makers starting in the mid-1970s, public knowledge of exact ingredients in vaccines or other pediatric injections became circumscribed. Vaccine makers no longer excitedly announced new ingredients as Merck did in 1964 with the peanut-oil-based Adjuvant 65-4. The public had no way of knowing fully what was being injected into their children.\n\nHowever, with the sharp rise in lawsuits against vaccine makers starting in the mid-1970s, public knowledge of exact ingredients in vaccines or other pediatric injections became circumscribed.

The public had no way of knowing fully what was being injected into their children.\nThe response to the increased number of lawsuits was not to reduce regulations regarding disclosure of ingredients, but to set up a \u201cno-fault\u201d vaccine\u00a0court to settle lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies that produce vaccines. This court significantly reduced pharmaceutical companies\u2019 liability, which would make them less concerned with lawsuits, not more.\u00a0 United States law remains quite clear on the labeling requirements for vaccines, according to\u00a0Section 610.61 of Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations.\nThis code explicitly requires the presence of any sensitizing substance (proteins left over from a vegetable oil, for instance) as well as the specific adjuvant present (along with pretty much every chemical that would have been used at any point, even if no longer present) to be clearly defined:\n\nThe following items shall appear on the label affixed to each package containing a product: [\u2026]\n(l) Known sensitizing substances, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n(m) The type and calculated amount of antibiotics added during manufacture;\n(n) The inactive ingredients when a safety factor, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n(o) The adjuvant, if present;\n(p) The source of the product when a factor in safe administration;\n(q) The identity of each microorganism used in manufacture, and, where applicable, the production medium and the method of inactivation, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n\nThe following items shall appear on the label affixed to each package containing a product: [\u2026]\n(l) Known sensitizing substances, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n(m) The type and calculated amount of antibiotics added during manufacture;\n(n) The inactive ingredients when a safety factor, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\n(o) The adjuvant, if present;\n(p) The source of the product when a factor in safe administration;\n(q) The identity of each microorganism used in manufacture, and, where applicable, the production medium and the method of inactivation, or reference to an enclosed circular containing appropriate information;\nThe complete contents of all US approved vaccines can be found on the CDC\u00a0web site.\nOk, So It\u2019s Not in Adjuvants, But They Do \u201cBrew\u201d Vaccines in Peanut Oil \u2014 False\nSome venues avoid the concept of peanut oil based adjuvants entirely. These publications, most notably Natural News (which referenced a series of posts authored by a \u201cdoctor\u201d who, by their own\u00a0disclaimer, may not exist), instead claim that peanut oil is (or could be) used as a \u201cgrowth medium\u201d in the production of vaccines, which could then leave undetectable traces of peanut proteins or other allergens that companies would be under no obligation to disclose:\n\nThe influenza vaccine is brewed in peanut oil that\u2019s not listed as an ingredient because only \u201ctrace amounts\u201d remain \u2013 not enough according to the FDA and CDC to harm people. Peanut oil has been used in vaccines since the 1960s, but because it doesn\u2019t \u201cshow up\u201d in the final vaccine product, the manufacturers are allowed to leave it off the package inserts.\nPeanut oil is just one \u201cgrowth medium\u201d that vaccine manufacturers use to make vaccines, like egg embryo (protein) and casein (milk). This is what they use to make MMR and influenza vaccines.\n\nThe influenza vaccine is brewed in peanut oil that\u2019s not listed as an ingredient because only \u201ctrace amounts\u201d remain \u2013 not enough according to the FDA and CDC to harm people.

A \u201cgrowth medium\u201d is simply a concoction of nutrients, sugars and other hydrocarbons that help either bacterial cells or cells hosting a virus to survive. In a post explaining why animal products are sometimes used to achieve this goal, the Food and Drug Administration\u00a0describes the basics:\n\nVaccines contain either killed or weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, or components of these that stimulate a response by the body\u2019s immune system, which then protects against the development of disease. In the late 19th century, microbiologists began to grow bacteria in the laboratory. The early bacteriologists tried to mimic as closely as possible the environment in an infected person\u2019s tissues by using solutions containing sugars, salts, and various meat extracts to make \u201cgrowth media.\u201d These kinds of conditions were quite successful in growing bacteria and then viruses in the lab, because these media supplied the many necessary nutrients. Although synthetic media have been developed for growth of many medically important microorganisms, some still require additional nutrients which are easily provided by animal-derived products such as serum and blood. Viral vaccines are produced in living cells, which, similarly, require the addition of complex growth media components, such as fetal calf serum.\n\nVaccines contain either killed or weakened forms of disease-causing bacteria or viruses, or components of these that stimulate a response by the body\u2019s immune system, which then protects against the development of disease.

From a legal standpoint, however, this too is false. As mentioned above,\u00a0U.S. law\u00a0requires \u201cthe identity of each microorganism used in manufacture, and, where applicable, the production medium\u201d to be disclosed.\nThe argument that pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t need to report things that appear only in trace amounts or not at all is equally false. According to the disclaimer on the CDC\u2019s list of vaccine ingredients:\n\nThis table includes not only vaccine ingredients (e.g., adjuvants and preservatives), but also substances used during the manufacturing process, including vaccine-production media, that are removed from the final product and present only in trace quantities.\n\nThis table includes not only vaccine ingredients (e.g., adjuvants and preservatives), but also substances used during the manufacturing process, including vaccine-production media, that are removed from the final product and present only in trace quantities.\nWhile some of these media are patented products, their method of production and ingredients are publicly\u00a0known\u00a0\u2014 and peanut oil free.\nThe Bottom Line\nDespite all of the above hoops one must jump through to debunk this myth, the basic facts are quite simple. Arguments suggesting that peanut oil is present in vaccines of any kind rely on using a clinical trial for a peanut-oil based adjuvant in the 1960s as evidence that peanut oil adjuvants are and have been in widespread use.\nThose trials were a failure. No peanut oil based adjuvants (or growth media) are used in human vaccines, and there are no legal loopholes (at least in the United States) that would allow pharmaceutical companies to avoid disclosure of different compounds used in their production. In response to our inquiry about the claims made in her book, Fraser told us:\n\nWhile the oil has a history of use in pharmaceuticals, I have no evidence that it is used in childhood vaccines.\n\nWhile the oil has a history of use in pharmaceuticals, I have no evidence that it is used in childhood vaccines.\nDespite this, Fraser\u2019s book is still often offered as the definitive source for the \u201cfact\u201d that childhood vaccines (or flu shots) contain peanut oil."}, "69": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/abortion-breast-cancer-link/", "title": "\tAre Abortions Linked to an Increased Risk of Breast Cancer?", "subtitle": "\t\tDespite early uncertainty, the weight of scientific evidence and medical consensus is that abortions do not lead to an increased risk of developing breast cancer.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["3 February 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/02/breast_cancer_mammography_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tStudies have proved that having an abortion increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nThe claim that undergoing an abortion increases a woman\u2019s chances of contracting breast cancer, often cited by anti-abortion activists, arguably has two origins: a scientific one and a political one. Its scientific origins have their roots in the 1980s and 1990s, with a series of studies investigating a link between induced abortions and an increased risk of breast cancer. Those early studies were ambiguous \u2014 no matter what side of the abortion issue one was on, one could (and still can) find a study to support their preferred narrative.\nFrom a scientific standpoint, the issue is no longer ambiguous. After an authoritative 1997 study utilizing government-collected data on every Danish women born between 1935 and 1978 concluded there was no increased risk of breast cancer from abortions, organizations such as the World Health Organization, U.S. National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and many others now reject the existence of any such link. The conclusions drawn from that study, as published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), were that:\n\nOverall, the risk of breast cancer in women with a history of induced abortion was not different from that in women without such a history, after potential confounding by age, parity, age at delivery of a first child, and calendar period was taken into account.\n\n\nOverall, the risk of breast cancer in women with a history of induced abortion was not different from that in women without such a history, after potential confounding by age, parity, age at delivery of a first child, and calendar period was taken into account.\n\nFrom a political standpoint, the issue saw a resurgence in attention under the socially conservative administration of George W. Bush, which changed the language on an National Cancer Institute fact sheet regarding breast cancer and abortions against the wishes of that organization\u2019s scientists. This issue was discussed, later, in an August 2003 US Congressional report from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that investigated changes to science policy under the Bush administration:\n\nUntil the summer of 2002, the National Cancer Institute posted an analysis on its web site concluding that the current body of scientific evidence does not support the claim that abortions increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer. The analysis explained that after some uncertainty before the mid-1990s, this issue had been resolved by several well-designed studies, the largest of which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997, finding no link between abortion and breast cancer risk.\nIn November 2002, however, the Bush Administration removed this analysis and posted new information about abortion and breast cancer on the NCI web site. [\u2026]\nThis new fact sheet erroneously suggested that whether abortion caused breast cancer was an open question with studies of equal weight supporting both sides. The New York Times called the NCI\u2019s new statement \u201can egregious distortion of the evidence.\u201d According to the director of epidemiology research for the American Cancer Society, \u201cThis issue has been resolved scientifically . . . . This is essentially a political debate.\u201d\nAfter members of Congress protested the change, NCI convened a three-day conference of experts on abortion and breast cancer. Participants reviewed all existing population-based, clinical, and animal data available, and concluded that \u201c[i]nduced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk,\u201d ranking this conclusion as \u201cwell-established.\u201d On March 21, 2003, the NCI web site was updated to reflect this conclusion.\n\n\nUntil the summer of 2002, the National Cancer Institute posted an analysis on its web site concluding that the current body of scientific evidence does not support the claim that abortions increase a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer.

It is widely accepted, for example, that carrying a pregnancy to term reduces one\u2019s risk of developing breast cancer later in life. This issue is often conflated with the question of abortions increasing a woman\u2019s risk, because since carrying a pregnancy to term may reduce risk of breast cancer, having an abortion may offset that reduced risk. That is not the question at hand, however: the question, strictly defined, is \u2018will having an abortion make you more likely to get breast cancer when compared to women who never give birth?\u2019\nThe scientific basis for the breast cancer-abortion link has its roots, most notably, in a 1980 paper in the American Journal of Pathology that investigated one potential mechanism proposed for relationships between abortion and breast cancer: that leftover undifferentiated cells in a woman\u2019s breast (which occur as part of hormonal changes that help to prepare a woman for breastfeeding and appear during pregnancy, and which would become fully differentiated by the end of a pregnancy) are more susceptible to cancer.\nTo test this notion, researchers intentionally injected laboratory rats with a carcinogen after interrupted pregnancies, and then compared these results to a series of rats who were never pregnant, and to rats that carried pregnancies to full term, to see if interrupted pregnancies were related to an increased susceptibility to developing cancerous cells.\nThe researchers demonstrated that the likelihood of developing cancerous cells was higher in those rats with interrupted pregnancies. The researchers suggested these results were consistent with the idea that the interruption of a pregnancy leaves undifferentiated cells in a woman\u2019s breast, and that these cells are more susceptible to cancer:\n\nWe show here that, in order to be protective, the development of the gland must be complete. Pregnant or lactating rats treated with chemical carcinogens respond with a significant reduction in mammary tumor incidence, while pregnancy interruption gives no protection at all. This is due to the fact that in the mammary gland of animals in which pregnancy has been interrupted, the glands contain some areas with completely differentiated structures and others in which undifferentiated structures prevailed.\n\n\nWe show here that, in order to be protective, the development of the gland must be complete.

This is due to the fact that in the mammary gland of animals in which pregnancy has been interrupted, the glands contain some areas with completely differentiated structures and others in which undifferentiated structures prevailed.\n\nSince then, a goal of many researchers has been to design studies to see if this mechanism is valid and if it may be relevant in humans as well. For obvious reasons, a carcinogen injection kind of experiment on humans is out of the question, so scientists have to settle for observational studies. The different ways in which one can go about designing such studies have created a cornucopia of results with differing levels of veracity that anyone can point to, in isolation, to support their narrative.\nIn terms of research on humans, there are two kinds of observational studies that would be used: case-control studies and cohort studies. In general, case control studies are smaller, and the way in which their control group is identified has the potential to be more subjective or error prone. The National Cancer Institute defines both as follows:\n\n[A case-control study is] a study that compares two groups of people: those with the disease or condition under study (cases) and a very similar group of people who do not have the disease or condition (controls). Researchers study the medical and lifestyle histories of the people in each group to learn what factors may be associated with the disease or condition. For example, one group may have been exposed to a particular substance that the other was not. Also called retrospective study.\n[A cohort study is] a research study that compares a particular outcome (such as lung cancer) in groups of individuals who are alike in many ways but differ by a certain characteristic (for example, female nurses who smoke compared with those who do not smoke).\n\n\n[A case-control study is] a study that compares two groups of people: those with the disease or condition under study (cases) and a very similar group of people who do not have the disease or condition (controls).

For, women who have had an induced abortion are known to under-report such events, but they might be more likely to disclose this information than they would otherwise have been if they had been diagnosed with breast cancer and knew that they were taking part in a research project investigating the causes of their disease. [\u2026]\nFor example, among women in a Swedish case-control study who had, in fact, had a previous induced abortion recorded on a national abortion register, 21% of those with breast cancer and 27% of those without the disease reported incorrectly that they had never had an induced abortion. Any such systematic differences between women with and without breast cancer in the under-reporting of past induced abortions could appreciably distort the results from studies with retrospectively recorded information on abortion [\u2026]\n\n\nThe findings from case-control studies \u2014 in which women were asked their abortion history after they were diagnosed with breast cancer \u2014 have been especially difficult to interpret.

Support for reporting bias as an explanation for regional differences was also found in data supplied by study participants and their physicians on the use of oral contraception. The authors conclude that reporting bias is a real problem in case-control studies of induced abortion and breast cancer risk if study findings are based solely upon information from study subjects.\n\n\nThe association between induced abortion and breast cancer was stronger in the southeastern regions of the country, where there is a predominantly Roman Catholic population, suggesting reporting bias.

It avoided reporting bias entirely by not conducting interviews at all, instead relying only on Danish data collected by the Danish government:\n\nIn our study, all the information on dates and the number of induced abortions, reproductive history, and cancer diagnosis was obtained from national registries, which are compiled through a system of mandatory reporting for the entire population. Follow-up included complete information on death and emigration and was performed through computerized linkage of registry information by means of individually identifiable registration numbers. These measures, we believe, allowed us to avoid some of the major methodologic problems of previous studies.\n\n\nIn our study, all the information on dates and the number of induced abortions, reproductive history, and cancer diagnosis was obtained from national registries, which are compiled through a system of mandatory reporting for the entire population.

These measures, we believe, allowed us to avoid some of the major methodologic problems of previous studies.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t find studies or individuals still suggesting a link between abortion and breast cancer. The non-profit Breast Cancer Prevention Institute (BCPI), founded by Joel Brind (one of the main scientists promoting the abortion and breast cancer connection), an organization whose sole purpose appears to be \u201ceducating\u201d people about said connection, presents a list of studies that they say support their argument. This list is heavily referenced on anti-abortion websites and can commonly be found shared with the claim that \u201c73 Studies Have Examined Abortion and Breast Cancer, 53 Show Higher Risk\u201d or similar.\nBCPI\u2019s is an extremely misleading representation of that information, however. Included among those (presently) 60 studies showing a \u201chigher risk\u201d of breast cancer from induced abortions, 23 were self-described on that organization\u2019s list as being not statistically significant. Suggesting that a statistically insignificant correlation supports any argument is, in a word, deceptive.\nThat leaves 37 studies with statistically significant positive correlations: a ragtag collection of studies as old as 1957 and as recent as 2013, all of which were case-control or meta-analyses that relied primarily on case-controlled studies, and many of which were designed to test questions other than the abortion-breast cancer connection itself.\nOne of the listed studies, discussed above, aimed to demonstrate (successfully) that case-control studies are a poor design to analyze a purported connection between abortions and breast cancer.\nTwo of the listed studies included on the list were not, strictly speaking, studies, as they were conference presentations that received little to no peer review (i.e. Laing et al 1994, Bu et al 1995). Many of the studies on the list (e.g., Segi et al 1957, Daling et al 1994, Daling et al 1996) cautioned that while they may have demonstrated  correlations, their data were not sufficient to establish causation or even to represent actual trends.\nFour of the studies on the list reached conclusions explicitly counter to the claim that they demonstrate an increased risk of breast in populations of women who have had abortions:\n\nRosenberg et al. 1998: \u201cThese data suggest that the risk of breast cancer is not materially affected by abortion, regardless of whether it occurs before or after the first term birth.\u201d\nLipworth et al. 1995: \u201cThe risk for breast cancer was not increased for women who had a history of abortion, compared to nulliparous women [women who never gave birth] with no history of abortion.\u201d\nTalamini et al. 1996: \u201cNo trend in risk was evident for induced abortions.\u201d\nTavani et al. 1996: \u201cOur results indicate a lack of association between induced and spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk.\u201d\n\n\nRosenberg et al. 1998: \u201cThese data suggest that the risk of breast cancer is not materially affected by abortion, regardless of whether it occurs before or after the first term birth.\u201d\nLipworth et al. 1995: \u201cThe risk for breast cancer was not increased for women who had a history of abortion, compared to nulliparous women [women who never gave birth] with no history of abortion.\u201d\nTalamini et al. 1996: \u201cNo trend in risk was evident for induced abortions.\u201d\nTavani et al. 1996: \u201cOur results indicate a lack of association between induced and spontaneous abortions and breast cancer risk.\u201d\n\nArguably the most notable publication on this list, both in scope and in citations, is a 1996 paper  authored by Brind himself (who created this list in the first place), a meta-review of 28 studies (many of which are also featured individually on the list). His own study concluded:\n\nThe results support the inclusion of induced abortion among significant independent risk factors for breast cancer, regardless of parity or timing of abortion relative to the first term pregnancy. Although the increase in risk was relatively low, the high incidence of both breast cancer and induced abortion suggest a substantial impact of thousands of excess cases per year currently, and a potentially much greater impact in the next century, as the first cohort of women exposed to legal induced abortion continues to age.\n\n\nThe results support the inclusion of induced abortion among significant independent risk factors for breast cancer, regardless of parity or timing of abortion relative to the first term pregnancy.

In Brind\u2019s study, however,\u00a0\u201cno quality criteria were imposed, but a narrative review of all included studies is presented for the reader\u2019s use in assessing the quality of individual studies.\u201d Numerous scientists have serious issues with it on this basis. A team of Harvard epidemiologists used Brind\u2019s methods in their own study, concluding that the causation he so confidently claimed the could not be made with the data he used.\nMads Melbye, author of the 1997 Danish cohort study, took issue with Brind\u2019s study as well, as covered in a history of the topic:\n\nCriticizing Brind directly, Melbye pointed out that he had relied almost entirely on case-control studies and had based his results on \u201ca crude analysis of published odds ratios and relative risks with no attempt to incorporate the original raw data into a more sophisticated statistical analysis\u201d\n\n\nCriticizing Brind directly, Melbye pointed out that he had relied almost entirely on case-control studies and had based his results on \u201ca crude analysis of published odds ratios and relative risks with no attempt to incorporate the original raw data into a more sophisticated statistical analysis\u201d\n\nOur classification of \u201cfalse\u201d acknowledges that some scientists and studies suggest a link between abortion and breast cancer, but that suggestion is rooted in the fact that the methodologies utilized in the studies supporting such a link are widely accepted as flawed by the majority of the scientific community and by the fact that large cohort studies, better suited to test this question in the first place, suggest that no link exists.\nObservational studies of any kind will always come with limitations and wiggle room for politically motivated players to exploit, as was the case 2002. As a whole, however, we regard use of these data to make a causal link between breast cancer and abortions, without any discussion of their significant caveats involved, intentionally misleading enough to be disqualifying."}, "70": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-fossil-fuels-cool/", "title": "\tDid a NASA Study Conclude That Burning Fossil Fuels Cools the Planet?", "subtitle": "\t\tThis claim is rooted in the willfully negligent reading of a NASA press release by a U.K. tabloid\u2019s \u201cscience and paranormal correspondent\u201d.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["30 January 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/fossil_fuel_pollution_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tNASA now says that burning fossil fuels cools the planet.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nThough a bit of misinformation about NASA\u2019s supposedly having said that the burning of fossil fuels actually cools the Earth\u2019s climate dates back to December 2015, it was recently dug up and reposted on the conservative website Louder with Crowder on 27 January 2017.

Images of Monster UFOs Circling Sun Emerge.\u201d\nIn that Express piece, also from 21 December 2015, Austin wrote:\nMajor theories about what causes temperatures to rise have been thrown into doubt after NASA found the Earth has cooled in areas of heavy industrialisation where more trees have been lost and more fossil fuel burning takes place.\nEnvironmentalists have long argued the burning of fossil fuels in power stations and for other uses is responsible for global warming and predicted temperature increases because of the high levels of carbon dioxide produced \u2014 which causes the global greenhouse effect.\nWhile the findings did not dispute the effects of carbon dioxide on global warming, they found aerosols \u2014 also given off by burning fossil fuels \u2014 actually cool the local environment, at least temporarily.\nMajor theories about what causes temperatures to rise have been thrown into doubt after NASA found the Earth has cooled in areas of heavy industrialisation where more trees have been lost and more fossil fuel burning takes place.\nEnvironmentalists have long argued the burning of fossil fuels in power stations and for other uses is responsible for global warming and predicted temperature increases because of the high levels of carbon dioxide produced \u2014 which causes the global greenhouse effect.\nWhile the findings did not dispute the effects of carbon dioxide on global warming, they found aerosols \u2014 also given off by burning fossil fuels \u2014 actually cool the local environment, at least temporarily.\nThis was a wholly dishonest and inaccurate representation of both the purpose of the referenced study and the nature of its results. The study, which neither of the above writers appeared to have read, aimed to improve the accuracy of a key metric derived from climate models.\nClimate modeling has as its goal the creation of a plausible simplification of the global climate system based on physics and historical data. These models are refined and tested, over time, by comparing multiple iterations of their results from a known historical starting point, and analyzed to see how well the models output matches the historical record. One of the most important things scientists attempt to ascertain with these global models is what is known as climate sensitivity \u2014 essentially a measurement of how much our planet warms as a result of a doubling of CO2.\nGetting the most accurate estimate of that metric, climate sensitivity, is in many senses the holy grail of climate modelers, because it is the key to developing confident predictions about future warming. Since the climate system is massive and affected by both short term and long term processes, sensitivity is often defined on two timescales: \u201cThe transient climate response (TCR: the warming after 70 years of CO2 concentrations that rise at 1% per year), and the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS: the equilibrium temperature change following a doubling of CO2 concentrations).\u201d\nThe underlying study, published on 14 December 2015 in the journal Nature Climate Change, attempted to refine estimates of those two variables by breaking a number of different aspects of the climate system into individual inputs, such as aerosols from pollution, ozone, solar variations, etc. This type of precision model testing is something made possible only recently by the collection of large datasets that document or estimate past variations in these more obscure metrics:\nThe NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) modelling group performed \u2018historical\u2019 simulations using model version GISS-E2-R [one of many models used by the IPCC] spanning 1850\u20132005, driven by estimates of relevant natural and external forcings. Multiple simulations over the same time period using single forcings or combinations of forcings were also [compared to historical data], including simulations forced by only well-mixed greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, ozone, solar variations, volcanoes, or land-use changes.\nThese unique ensembles allow us to replicate climate sensitivity calculations in a \u2018perfect model\u2019 framework, in which we have all the information we need to determine transient and equilibrium sensitivities using previously published methods, which can be compared to the actual TCR \u00a0and ECS of the GISS-E2-R model.\nThe NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) modelling group performed \u2018historical\u2019 simulations using model version GISS-E2-R [one of many models used by the IPCC] spanning 1850\u20132005, driven by estimates of relevant natural and external forcings.

This is largely a result of the low efficacy of ozone and volcanic forcings and the high efficacy of aerosol and LU forcing (which have had a cooling effect over the historical period), although further study is needed to explore model differences in simulating efficacies and to enhance confidence in these estimates.\nGISS ModelE2 is more sensitive to CO2 alone than it is to the sum of the forcings that were important over the past century.

Accounting for this results in recent historical estimates for TCR and ECS that are more consistent with constraints based on palaeoclimate data and process-based constraints from modern climatology.\nClimate sensitivities estimated from recent observations will therefore be biased low in comparison with CO2-only simulations owing to an accident of history: when the efficacies of the forcings in the recent historical record are properly taken into account, estimates of TCR and ECS must be revised upwards. Accounting for this results in recent historical estimates for TCR and ECS that are more consistent with constraints based on palaeoclimate data and process-based constraints from modern climatology.\nIn other words, the study found that estimates of how much global warming could be expected in the long term from release of CO2 used in current climate models (which are frequently derived from relatively recent satellite data), are actually too low, because they are masked by a stronger than assumed short-term dampening effect from fossil fuel aerosols (particulate matter that serve to block incoming sunlight) and the effect of deforestation (which can sometimes cause more energy to be reflected back into space).\nThe authors are actually arguing that future temperatures could well be warmer than predicted as a result of what they learned from the study. In a NASA press release, Gavin Schmitt, one of the authors of this study, said:\nIf you\u2019ve got a systematic underestimate of what the greenhouse gas-driven change would be, then you\u2019re systematically underestimating what\u2019s going to happen in the future when greenhouse gases are by far the dominant climate driver.\nIf you\u2019ve got a systematic underestimate of what the greenhouse gas-driven change would be, then you\u2019re systematically underestimating what\u2019s going to happen in the future when greenhouse gases are by far the dominant climate driver.\nWhat the study did not find, however, was evidence that fossil fuels cool the planet. They don\u2019t. The planet is getting warmer and is doing so, broadly, in concert with rising fossil fuel emissions.\nAdditionally, this study (counter to the implication of the viral news reports) didn\u2019t \u201cdiscover\u201d the effects of aerosols, nor did it discover the effects of deforestation on the climate system. From a general standpoint, the dampening effect of aerosols and deforestation on Earth\u2019s climate have been known for decades.\nA 1967 paper in the journal Science, for example, attempted to calculate the effect of aerosols on temperature, suggesting that aerosols may have been responsible for a perceived cooling trend in spite of rising CO2 temperatures \u2014 the very dynamics the study in question attempted to elucidate through modeling:\nWe suggest that the effects of man\u2019s pollution of his environment are monotonically increasing along with the world population. The emission of long-lived aerosol, keeping pace with the accelerated worldwide production of CO2 may well be leading to the decrease in worldwide air temperature in spite of the apparent buildup of CO2. In any case, it is clear that in this \u201clarge-scale geophysical experiment\u201d in which human beings are engaged, the course of atmospheric turbidity must be documented with concern.\nWe suggest that the effects of man\u2019s pollution of his environment are monotonically increasing along with the world population.

In any case, it is clear that in this \u201clarge-scale geophysical experiment\u201d in which human beings are engaged, the course of atmospheric turbidity must be documented with concern.\nThe famed science communicator Carl Sagan himself pontificated over the various ways in which deforestation could affect Earth\u2019s climate in a 1979 paper also published in Science, figuring that it had any effect it would be to cool the planet:\nThe massive extinction of equatorial forests [could potentially] have important implications for the global as well as the regional climate. We suggest that major deforestation in equatorial latitudes may be a matter of international concern, and note the systematic destruction of the Amazon jungle now under way, the activity of several corporations in a single country.\nThis activity may even be desirable, as a counterbalance to greenhouse heating of the earth; but it would seem prudent, on an issue of possible global importance, to study its implications in some detail before proceeding unilaterally.\nThe massive extinction of equatorial forests [could potentially] have important implications for the global as well as the regional climate.

Indeed, scientists are not debating the questions viral stories like those written by Kirchoff suggest: the climate warming potential of burning fossil fuels has been known for well over a century."}, "71": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/will-a-doomsday-asteroid-destroy-earth-in-february-2017/", "title": "\tWill a Doomsday Asteroid Destroy Earth in February 2017?", "subtitle": "\t\tThere may well be plenty of things to worry about, but a civilization-destroying asteroid is not one of them.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["26 January 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/NASA_asteroid_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tNASA is lying about the path of a recently discovered asteroid, and it will actually cause widespread destruction when it hits Earth in February 2017.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 25 January 2017, the\u00a0Daily Mail published a report with the terrifying headline: \u201cA doomsday asteroid will hit Earth next month and trigger devastating mega-tsunamis, claims conspiracy theorist\u201d.

While an undetected planet may well\u00a0exist in our solar system, there is a fairly specific area in which it would be found, and nothing leaving that distant region of space in October is going to be hitting us this February \u2014\u00a0even if it were on the right trajectory.\nSecond, even the Daily Mail seems to think the man on whom \u00a0they have based their entire article may not exist:\n\nThe name \u2018Dyomin Damir Zakharovich\u2019 seems to have only appeared online in recent months, relating to doomsday reports regarding the fictional planet Nibiru.\n\nThe name \u2018Dyomin Damir Zakharovich\u2019 seems to have only appeared online in recent months, relating to doomsday reports regarding the fictional planet Nibiru.\nWhat we do know for sure, though, is that all available data suggests it is not a risk to our planet.

He explains the basic rationale in a November 2016 post:\n\nThe Chinese found that there are thousands of tiny nerve endings on the bottom of the feet. These nerve endings act as access points to the internal organs. They are also closely linked to the nervous system. Onions have strong anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. When you cut an onion and place it on the bottom of the foot, it gets right to work removing toxins and healing your body.\n\nThe Chinese found that there are thousands of tiny nerve endings on the bottom of the feet.

When you cut an onion and place it on the bottom of the foot, it gets right to work removing toxins and healing your body.\nIf that explanation isn\u2019t doing it for you, Wolfe provides additional reasoning as well. But, like a desperate student called on in class after a heavy night of not studying, Wolfe lists numerous unrelated, disconnected, illogical, and wholly inaccurate claims about how an onions on your feet might impart a health benefit in the hopes that the sheer volume of answers will not betray his own lack of knowledge.\nOnly three of these five explanations hold even a modicum of relevance to the onion sock theory:\n\nOnions detox the body \u2013 Onions are rich in sulphuric compounds. These compounds are responsible for their strong odor. Sulfer [sic] helps the body release unwanted toxins, especially in the liver.\nOnions purify your blood \u2013 While the onion is next to your foot, phosphoric acid is released. It enters your bloodstream and helps to purify the blood running through your veins. [\u2026]\nOnions support the immune system \u2013 Thanks to the anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties of onions, your immune system becomes better prepared to fight off infections and inflammation.

[\u2026]\nWith these claims in place, we can get a general picture of how Wolfe and others suggest this works: Borrowing from the Traditional Chinese Medicine concept of meridians, the feet are a gateway to multiple organ systems in your body which allow chemicals from the onion to enter your bloodstream like a portal, where they get to purifying, bacteria killing, and virus fighting.\nFirst off, the existence of meridians have not been demonstrated scientifically, and even if they had been, practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine describe their action as transporting energy or \u201cqi\u201d, not as transporting actual physical compounds, so Wolfe\u2019s description of the mechanism by which beneficial onion compounds make it to your body is not off to a great start.\nIgnoring this problematic beginning, the next claim refers to an onion\u2019s sulphuric compounds. They do indeed exist, and they have indeed been proposed as the primary chemicals responsible for an onion\u2019s medicinal benefits. A 2002 review in the journal Phytotherapy describes these chemicals and lists their potential health effects:\n\nOnions are rich in two chemical groups that have perceived benefits to human health. These are the flavonoids and the alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxides (ACSOs). [\u2026]. The ACSOs are the flavour precursors, which, when cleaved by the enzyme alliinase, generate the characteristic odour and taste of onion.\nThe downstream products are a complex mixture of [sulfur-based compounds]. Compounds from onion have been reported to have a range of health benefits which include anticarcinogenic properties, antiplatelet activity, antithrombotic activity, antiasthmatic and antibiotic effects.\n\nOnions are rich in two chemical groups that have perceived benefits to human health.

Compounds from onion have been reported to have a range of health benefits which include anticarcinogenic properties, antiplatelet activity, antithrombotic activity, antiasthmatic and antibiotic effects.\nUnfortunately for proponents of onion foot therapy, these potential benefits all necessitate the ingestion of these compounds, not passively leaving the entity responsible for their creation in close proximity to one\u2019s foot. Ultimately, this kind of reasoning is a lazy distraction, equating the benefits of ingestion with other less plausible, and often undefined, pathways.\nWhile there have been some limited studies regarding some of these (ingested) benefits in laboratory settings, it needs to be noted that there has been little research definitively showing these effects on humans (though there is also a lack of research in general on the topic), per that same review:\n\nClearly there are many claims on health benefits of Alliums [the genus that includes Onions], however, most, with the exception of garlic, have not received any rigorous (or even gentle) scientific investigation\n\nClearly there are many claims on health benefits of Alliums [the genus that includes Onions], however, most, with the exception of garlic, have not received any rigorous (or even gentle) scientific investigation\nFurther, the notion that these sulfur-based chemicals \u201crelease\u201d toxins is vague oversimplification. The argument could be made that the antioxidant properties of some\u00a0onion chemicals aid in the cleansing of \u201ctoxins\u201d from your body,\u00a0 but, again, you would need to be ingesting said chemicals.\nIn the same vein as releasing toxins is the notion that the phosphoric acid found in onions cleanses your blood. The inclusion of this pro-phosphoric acid statement is odd for a David Wolfe page, given the fact that he rails against the chemical on his\u00a0other pages.\nThough there are myriad problems with the idea that phosphoric acid cleanses your blood and with the notion that topical application of it on your foot would have any effect whatsoever, all of these issues are irrelevant as onions do not contain phosphoric acid to begin with.\nIn fact, phosphoric acid is used in laboratory\u00a0settings to liberate compounds from onions and garlic for analysis. Every so often, alarm bells are sounded on food blogs about the inclusion of phosphoric acid as a preservative in minced packages of (the closely related) garlic. Needless to say, the lack of phosphoric acid in onions is another serious blow to the proffered theories for why sock onions could have medicinal properties.\nIn terms of the onion\u2019s ability to boost your immune system through their antibacterial and antiviral compounds there are two ways to look at it: Yes, onions have been shown in laboratory settings to fight both viruses as well as bacteria and conceivably, these compounds could have a benefit to you \u2014 but, again, only when ingested.\nIn this case, as well, the topical application of some chemicals in onions could kill bacteria externally. However, just as the ingestion of onions will not reduce external bacterial infections, neither will a topical application be effective at creating any change to the internal systems of one\u2019s body, as claimed.\nAll things considered, the evidence presented to support this fairly outlandish notion is either false or misleading, and we cannot find any plausible mechanism for a raw cut onion stuffed in your sock to reduce any disease."}, "73": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cancer-vitamin-b17-deficiency/", "title": "\tIs Cancer Caused by a Deficiency of \u2018Vitamin B17\u2019?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe fact that there is no such thing as vitamin B17 is among the least problematic elements of the myth that it can help remedy cancer.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["13 January 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/vitamin_B17_cancer_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tCancer is caused by a deficiency of vitamin \u201cB17,\u201d a condition that can be remedied with nutritional supplements.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nDiscussion of the cancer-fighting properties of a chemical (variously referred to as amygdalin, laetrile, or\u00a0\u201cvitamin B17\u201d) has been a fixture of the so-called alternative medicine movement for decades.

No official pharmacopoeia lists it as a vitamin, and it does not possess any of the required characteristics of a vitamin.\nIn a hearing about an 1976 injunction demanding that a company cease selling supplements with this compound, a federal court described the vitamin defense as \u201ca patently absurd and transparent attempt to avoid the drug labeling provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\u201d\nAmygdalin is a naturally occurring compound that can be found in a variety of foods, most notably bitter almonds and the pits of apricots and other fruits. Claims that it is a potential cancer therapy can be credited to the father and son team of Ernst Krebs Sr. (a doctor and pharmacist with a long history of promoting fringe folk remedies) and Ernst Krebs Jr. (who was not a doctor nor even the recipient of any degree in science, save an honorary doctorate from a now-defunct university). Their work is described in a 1981 review on the topic:\nIn the 1920s, working in a home laboratory to find a method for improving the taste of bootleg whiskey, an obscure San Francisco general practitioner, Dr. Ernst Krebs, Sr., suggested that an extract of apricot seeds reduced rodent tumors. Dr. Krebs warned that the material, which in 1936 appeared to be predominantly the common chemical amygdalin, was too unpredictable and too dangerous for general human use.\nIts promotion did not really begin until over 20 years later when his son, Ernst Krebs, Jr.. claimed to have synthesized a safe congener of amygdalin, for which he coined the term \u201claetrile\u201d. In spite the younger Mr. Krebs\u2019 claims, most of what has since been sold as laetrile has consisted of a variety of components and the active portion has usually been amygdalin itself.\nIn the 1920s, working in a home laboratory to find a method for improving the taste of bootleg whiskey, an obscure San Francisco general practitioner, Dr. Ernst Krebs, Sr., suggested that an extract of apricot seeds reduced rodent tumors.

As summarized by a National Institutes of Health Physician Data Query report, most invoke the fact that laetrile is toxic to cancer cells (which is almost certainly related to the fact that it metabolizes into cyanide) but not other cells:\nThe [first] rationale for laetrile use is the suggestion that malignant cells have higher than normal levels of an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase [\u2026] and that they are deficient in another enzyme called rhodanese [\u2026]. it has been proposed that cancer cells are more susceptible to the toxic effects of laetrile than normal cells because of an imbalance in these two enzymes.\nThe second theory states that cancer cells contain more beta-glucosidase [which is different than beta-glucuronidase mentioned above] activity than normal cells and, as in the first theory, that they are deficient in rhodanese.\nThe third theory states that cancer is the result of a metabolic disorder caused by a vitamin deficiency. It states further that laetrile, or amygdalin/vitamin B-17, is the missing vitamin needed by the body to restore health. [\u2026] there is no evidence that laetrile is needed for normal metabolism or that it can function as a vitamin in animals or humans.\nThe fourth theory suggests that the cyanide released by laetrile has a toxic effect beyond its interference with oxygen utilization by cells. According to this theory, cyanide increases the acid content of tumors and leads to the destruction of lysosomes (compartments inside cells that contain enzymes capable of breaking down other cellular molecules). The injured lysosomes release their contents, thereby killing the cancer cells and arresting tumor growth.\nThe [first] rationale for laetrile use is the suggestion that malignant cells have higher than normal levels of an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase [\u2026] and that they are deficient in another enzyme called rhodanese [\u2026]. it has been proposed that cancer cells are more susceptible to the toxic effects of laetrile than normal cells because of an imbalance in these two enzymes.\nThe second theory states that cancer cells contain more beta-glucosidase [which is different than beta-glucuronidase mentioned above] activity than normal cells and, as in the first theory, that they are deficient in rhodanese.\nThe third theory states that cancer is the result of a metabolic disorder caused by a vitamin deficiency.

The injured lysosomes release their contents, thereby killing the cancer cells and arresting tumor growth.\nIn fact, the rationale for laetrile\u2019s efficacy is not the only thing that has shifted over the course of its promotion; what conditions or health problems it is meant to ameliorate have also jumped around, as discussed in a 1977 FDA report:\nOver the years, proponents have claimed that Laetrile is a cure for cancer, that it is palliative, that it prevents cancer, that it is a painkiller, or that it facilitates other cancer treatments. There have even\u00a0 been claim that Laetrile raises the red count in blood, is of value in treating in treating sickle cell anemia, can be used to treat parasitic diseases, helps regulate intestinal flora,, causes a lowering of blood pressure in cancer victims and provides relief from arthritis.\u00a0\nOver the years, proponents have claimed that Laetrile is a cure for cancer, that it is palliative, that it prevents cancer, that it is a painkiller, or that it facilitates other cancer treatments. There have even\u00a0 been claim that Laetrile raises the red count in blood, is of value in treating in treating sickle cell anemia, can be used to treat parasitic diseases, helps regulate intestinal flora,, causes a lowering of blood pressure in cancer victims and provides relief from arthritis.\u00a0\nThe definition of what chemically constitutes both laetrile and \u201cvitamin B17\u201d has been equally fluid. Though classically defined by Krebs Jr. as a specific compound named \u201claevo-mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronoside,\u201d numerous tests have shown that this product is not what is found in most laetrile or B17 products.\nIn many studies, amygdalin and laevo-mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronoside are taken to be the same thing, despite the fact that they are not (recall that the reason a \u201csynthetic version\u201d of amygdalin was needed was rooted in Kreb Sr.\u2019s conclusion that the natural version was too toxic for human use). Other claims suggest an even broader definition, which includes an entire class of structurally related compounds variously named nitrilosides or laetrile.\nOvershadowing this unceasing onslaught quacktastic red flags are two hard truths: 1) there is effectively no evidence that laetrile, amygdalin, B17, etc., have any efficacy as a cancer treatment for humans and 2) there is plenty of evidence to suggest that amygdalin and related compounds are extremely toxic to humans, a problem compounded by the fact that several studies have shown that amygdalin supplements vary wildly in the accuracy of their concentrations and are completely unregulated.\nIn response to pressure from pro-laetrile groups during its heyday in the 1970s, the National Cancer Institute conducted a retrospective review, published in 1976 of people who had been treated with laetrile for cancer. They did this by soliciting information by mail from 385,000 physicians and 70,000 other health professionals known to treat patients with laetrile, as well as by soliciting information directly from members of pro-Laetrile groups.\nOf the 70,000 cases estimated to have been treated with the chemical at the time, only 93 were submitted for review. A further 26 were eliminated due to insufficient data, revealing, ultimately, only six that could be described as \u201cproducing a response\u201d:\nA panel of 12 oncologists, who had no knowledge of the actual treatments given, was then asked to evaluate the results of 160 courses of treatment (68 Laetrile, 68 chemotherapy, 24 \u201cno treatment\u201d) in the abstracted records from 93 patients. The panel judged six Laetrile courses to have produced a response (two complete and four partial). These results allow no definite conclusions supporting the anti-cancer activity of Laetrile. The National Cancer Institute will use the data in deciding if further study is needed.\nA panel of 12 oncologists, who had no knowledge of the actual treatments given, was then asked to evaluate the results of 160 courses of treatment (68 Laetrile, 68 chemotherapy, 24 \u201cno treatment\u201d) in the abstracted records from 93 patients. The panel judged six Laetrile courses to have produced a response (two complete and four partial). These results allow no definite conclusions supporting the anti-cancer activity of Laetrile. The National Cancer Institute will use the data in deciding if further study is needed.\nIn a followup to this report, a 1982 human trial that treated 78 cancer patients with amygdalin, published the New England Journal of Medicine, concluded:\nNo substantive benefit was observed in terms of cure, improvement or stabilization of cancer, improvement of symptoms related to cancer, or extension of lifespan.\nNo substantive benefit was observed in terms of cure, improvement or stabilization of cancer, improvement of symptoms related to cancer, or extension of lifespan.\nA 2015 review of over 200 citations related to amygdalin, laetrile, and cancer concluded:\nThe claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data.\nThe claims that laetrile or amygdalin have beneficial effects for cancer patients are not currently supported by sound clinical data.\nThese results are not to say that amygdalin and related compounds do not do anything. In that same 1982 human trial, researchers documented both the aforementioned lack of efficacy, as well its potentially fatal toxicity:\nThe hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range. Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment.\nThe hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range. Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment.\nThis, too, was echoed in the previously cited 2015 evidence review, which stated:\nThere is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk-benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.\nThere is a considerable risk of serious adverse effects from cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, especially after oral ingestion. The risk-benefit balance of laetrile or amygdalin as a treatment for cancer is therefore unambiguously negative.\nThe weight of this evidence has not deterred natural health evangelists like Joseph Mercola (who was recently ordered by the FTC to pay back over five million dollars in money generated from selling his own brand of indoor tanning beds that, in his words, \u201cslash your risk of cancer\u201d) from suggesting that the weight of scientific evidence is on their side.\nMercola, in a 2014 post that appears on many other websites, lists five studies which he says demonstrates the effectiveness of laetrile. None of these studies were based on human trials or data generated by the compound\u2019s actual clinical use (unlike the large scale clinical trials and retrospective reviews and meta-reviews mentioned above); they were either cell line studies or studies based on laboratory animals.\nThat promotion of \u201cvitamin B17\u201d is still a viable business model online is thanks, in large part, to the efforts of individuals with political or financial motives, but whose medical background might best be described as non-existent.\nThat movement got a huge lift in 1973 when a public relations officer at Sloan Kettering Hospital, which was given the task by the NIH\u00a0of performing a series of laetrile trials,\u00a0alleged a cover up of, and leaked, data that claimed\u00a0potential for laetrile as an anti-cancer agent. Despite the fact that no scientist could reproduce those results in a series of followups, the view of a government cover-up created a media sensation,\u00a0and has left a mark on its research that still resonates today.\nThat former public relations writer, Dr. Ralph W. Moss (who has a Ph.D in classics, not science) is now one of the leading advocates for laetrile. For the low price of $297.00, he will provide you with a personalized \u201cMoss Report\u201d about your cancer diagnosis.\u00a0He even provides one hour phone consultations to discuss treatment options. The legally required disclaimer on his website reads \u201cnothing Ralph W. Moss, PhD, says in your telephone consultation constitutes medical advice.\u201d\nPerhaps the most prominent force keeping the laetrile myth alive is the book \u201cWorld Without Cancer: The Story of Vitamin B17\u201d (which was very positively reviewed by \u201cDr.\u201d Ernst Krebs Jr himself!) by G. Edward Griffith, a libertarian activist with no medical training. Despite his book being basis for many pro-laetrile arguments, Griffith himself seems to be less enthused by that notion these days, as evidenced by this fairly convoluted\u00a0introduction on his web site VitaminB17.org:\nAs webmaster of VitaminB17.org, certainly I believe in B17. I wouldn\u2019t have spent my time and personal resources on this site all these years if I didn\u2019t believe in it. The thing about life is, you can only go by the best information you have at the time. You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. While I still believe in B17, new information has come to light that I believe is not only also valid information, but more central to cancer than B17. That said, I still would pursue B17 as a treatment for cancer.\nAs webmaster of VitaminB17.org, certainly I believe in B17.

This 1981 assessment is still the opinion held by the scientific community today:\nAll prior forms of cancer quackery [\u2026] pale in comparison with the laetrile crusade, unquestionably the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history.\nAll prior forms of cancer quackery [\u2026] pale in comparison with the laetrile crusade, unquestionably the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history."}, "74": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hairy-spider-monkey-found-mars/", "title": "\t\u2018Hairy Spider Monkey\u2019 Found on Mars?", "subtitle": "\t\tUnless \u2018hairy spider monkey\u2019 is your name for \u2018run-of-the-mill Mars rock\u2019, this report is something of a letdown.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["3 January 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/01/mars_spider_dog_feature.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tClose examination of a photograph taken by NASA\u2019s Mars Curiosity Rover shows the presence of a hairy, spider-monkey like creature.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 29 December 2016, UFO Sightings Daily blogger Scott Waring posted an image from the Mars Curiosity Rover that purportedly shows the presence of a \u201chairy spider monkey\u201d on Mars:\n\n\nI found this four legged alien creature on Mars and it looks like a hairy spider monkey.

It was taken with Curiosity\u2019s \u201cMastcam\u201d on 11 March 2016, some 1,278 Martian days into its mission.

As a reference point, the amount of energy it takes for the closely related howler monkey to merely exist (let alone grow) in a tropical environment is 602 Calories per day. As this specific primate-like critter would be surviving in temperatures that regularly hit -100\u00baF, its metabolic costs would undoubtedly be higher.\nAs the unequivocal presence of organic compounds suitable for present day, non-chemotrophic metabolism has yet to be found, it is unclear where in the barren sandstones of the Naukluft Plateau this energy would come from.

The only official policy statement that directly touches this topic is a memo, termed a \u201ccompliance policy guide\u201d issued in response to a 1957 internal inquiry between the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms taxation and enforcement offices:\n\nQuestions have been raised as to whether we can or should continue to consider synthetic alcohol unsuitable for food use. In order to secure more information, we wrote to the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division, Internal Revenue Service. Their reply included the following paragraphs:\nPresently, we authorize the manufacture of vinegar from ethyl alcohol synthesized from natural gas or petroleum derivatives. It is our opinion that most of the distilled spirits used in the production of vinegar are derived from natural gas and petroleum. When such alcohol is used in the production of vinegar, we would consider any reference to \u2018grain alcohol\u2019 or \u2018neutral grain spirits\u2019 would be misleading for the alcohol and also the name \u2018grain vinegar\u2019 would be misleading, except for connoting strength, e.g., 40-grains.\nWhen alcohol is used in the production of beverage products, our regulations require that the source of the alcohol be shown on the label except for cordials and liqueurs. Incidentally, I might add that most of the alcohol used in the production of medicinal preparations and flavors is synthetic.\u201d\nPractically and scientifically, pure ethyl alcohol synthesized from natural gas or petroleum products does not differ from that obtained by fermentation with subsequent distillation.

Thomas Hogue, the Director of Congressional and Public Affairs for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, provided this response:\n\nI\u2019m not aware of anything that prohibit you from using synthetic alcohol to produce a beverage alcohol product.\n\n\nI\u2019m not aware of anything that prohibit you from using synthetic alcohol to produce a beverage alcohol product.\n\nHe added that it is up to the FDA to determine what is safe, but up to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to prevent consumers from being misled. In that respect, he stated that while it would be legal to use synthetic alcohol, it would have to be labeled accordingly:\n\nI think you can reasonably assume that most consumers are going to expect that any beverage alcohol product they\u2019re drinking comes from fermentation of grains, fruits, or other plant materials. They\u2019re not going to automatically assume that it comes from a synthetic alcohol derived from petroleum or something like that. With that in mind, we would be requiring anybody who makes any product along those lines to label it with a truthful statement of composition. That label would need to have some sort of statement on it that it\u2019s synthetic alcohol derived from petroleum or something very similar to that, and make sure the consumer is not misled about what it is that they\u2019re purchasing.\n\n\nI think you can reasonably assume that most consumers are going to expect that any beverage alcohol product they\u2019re drinking comes from fermentation of grains, fruits, or other plant materials.

However, this is not a test that the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau utilizes, per Hogue:\n\nWe do regularly test beverage alcohol. We pull product from the marketplace. Every year we pull a representative sample from the marketplace and test it for a variety of things, but not to determine whether or not it\u2019s synthetic.\n\n\nWe do regularly test beverage alcohol.

That argument, when intelligible, usually invokes some sort of interplay between the salt, which attracts water from the air, and the heat from the light evaporating that water, as described in a non-peer-reviewed 2010 paper in the Pakistan Journal of Molecular Biology:\nThe negative ions are generated by a continuous interplay of water attraction and evaporation. The salt crystal lamp attracts water molecules from the surrounding air to its warm surface. The water and salt form a solution. In the process of evaporation of the solution, due to the heat of the lamp, negatively charged ions are created. Both positive and negative ions are created but much more negative ions than positive ions are created, therefore providing a surplus of negative ions. Natrium [another word for sodium] is positively charged. This unique ion emission interplay ability with water is because of salt\u2019s neutral atomic structure.\nThe negative ions are generated by a continuous interplay of water attraction and evaporation.

This unique ion emission interplay ability with water is because of salt\u2019s neutral atomic structure.\nThis explanation has the great benefit of sounding scientific. Who really knows how ions are formed in the first place or what will happen to blocks of heated salt rock, anyway? One person with pretty deep knowledge on the topic is Caltech professor of chemistry Jack Beauchamp, an expert in (among other things) the myriad processes that generate ions and the analytical methods used to detect those ions.\nBeauchamp was skeptical that a heated block of sodium chloride would produce ions (any amount of them, positive or negative ones, let alone \u201cboundless amounts\u201d) but not so skeptical that he didn\u2019t want to hook up the most popular salt lamp available from Amazon.com to his lab\u2019s quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. This instrument, in essence, sucks in air from directly around the solid and analyzes the mass and charge of particles captured by the instrument. Here\u2019s Beauchamp description of what he did in his own words:\nWe have a lot of experience with observing ions. What we did with the lamp, since it\u2019s supposed to make negative ions, was to place it adjacent to the inlet and, just by itself, we observed no ions at all. We turned it on and looked for negative ions. We looked for positive ions. We waited for the lamp to heat up. The bulb inside eventually does heat the rock salt, but we didn\u2019t see anything.\nI can\u2019t think of any physical process that would result in the formation of Ions from heating rock salt, with and without the presence of water vapor in any amount. Rock salt has a face-centered cubic structure which would not be expected give rise to electric fields that would generate ions around individual crystals.\nWe have a lot of experience with observing ions.

Rock salt has a face-centered cubic structure which would not be expected give rise to electric fields that would generate ions around individual crystals.\nThe structure aspect is important, says Beauchamp. One way to get crystals to generate ions is to alter the shape of its crystal structure via temperature, something that can happen if a crystal structure is asymmetric. He points to a crystal called lithium tantalate, which changes its crystal structure when heated up in such a way as to create areas of high and low electrical potential when heated or cooled. This property allows it to generate an electric field that could, in theory, ionize the air around it. Sodium chloride\u2019s chemical structure is a symmetrical cube that does not have the capability to generate high electric fields in the vicinity of a crystal.\nThe bottom line, according to Beauchamp and other chemists, is that there is no reason why putting a 15\u201345 watt bulb in a block of sodium chloride would do anything to generate ions, and this suspicion was confirmed by testing one of the most popular salt lamp models on the market with a machine designed specifically to detect ion formation.\nHowever, since one should always be concerned with low-sample, un-peer reviewed research (as our salt lamp experiment undoubtedly was), it is worthwhile looking into the claims that rely on salt lamps\u2019 producing the ions we could not find, as these are equally tenuous in their scientific validity.\nThey emit \u201cboundless amounts\u201d of negative ions, which counter the positive ions that both surround us and make us feel bad.\n\u00a0As discussed above, \u201cboundless amounts\u201d of negative ions would be a bit of a stretch, given the total and complete lack of any ions generated by our lamp. Ignoring that fact, however, brings us to the claim that positive ions make us feel bad and negative ions make us feel great. In terms of effects on mood, there is some research that suggests that negative ions can play a role in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. A 1998 study in JAMA psychiatry found, for example, that:\nBright light and high-density negative air ionization both appear to act as specific antidepressants in patients with seasonal affective disorder. Whether clinical improvement would be further enhanced by their use in combination, or as adjuvants to medication, awaits investigation.\nBright light and high-density negative air ionization both appear to act as specific antidepressants in patients with seasonal affective disorder. Whether clinical improvement would be further enhanced by their use in combination, or as adjuvants to medication, awaits investigation.\nA similar 2006 study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, hinted at at the possibility that high concentrations of negative ions could aid in the treatment of seasonal affective disorder. A 2013 review concluded, more broadly, that negative ions at very high concentrations had an effect on improving mood.\nThese studies, however, used high concentrations of negative ions generated by industrial scale ion generators. Seeing as we have uncovered no evidence to support the claim a salt lamp produces any ions, the notion that a $29.99 block of rock with a light bulb could rival the power of a specifically designed laboratory equipment seems dubious. Much of the pseudoscience written about the positive effects of negative ions similarly disregards scale in their analyses, equating negative ionization at any level as the same phenomenon.\nThose ions increase oxygen flow to the brain, which combats lethargy, gives you more energy, and causes you to be more alert and responsive to your surroundings.\n\u00a0There are two main arguments one could make to suggest negative ions increase oxygen flow to the brain or provide you with more energy. The first one is that negative ions increase respiratory function and, as a consequence, would allow your body to deliver more oxygen overall. This claim, though oft repeated, has very little evidence to support it. A 2013 systematic review of papers investigating a relationship between exposure to ions and respiratory health stated:\nDespite numerous experimental and analytical differences across studies, the literature does not clearly support a beneficial role in exposure to negative air ions and respiratory function or asthmatic symptom alleviation. Further, collectively, the human experimental studies do not indicate a significant detrimental effect of exposure to positive air ions on respiratory measures. Exposure to negative or positive air ions does not appear to play an appreciable role in respiratory function.\nDespite numerous experimental and analytical differences across studies, the literature does not clearly support a beneficial role in exposure to negative air ions and respiratory function or asthmatic symptom alleviation. Further, collectively, the human experimental studies do not indicate a significant detrimental effect of exposure to positive air ions on respiratory measures. Exposure to negative or positive air ions does not appear to play an appreciable role in respiratory function.\nThe other claim, discussed in more detail below, has to do with a study published on the effects of ionization in neural structures and blood flow in laboratory rats. In a similar issue of blindly comparing different scales, these rats (which are both not human and much smaller than humans) were directly fed negatively ionized air at high concentrations that would be inconceivable for a block of salt to produce, even if it did produce some small amount of ions.\nThe ions negate the radioactive waves or \u201celectric smog\u201d emitted by our electrical devices.\n\u00a0While \u201cradioactive waves\u201d are not\u2014strictly speaking\u2014a thing, what the author is likely talking about is an electromagnetic field generated by household electronics. The issue is that the only problem a salt lamp (via its dubious negative ionizer mechanism) would theoretically solve is a preponderance of positively charged ions in the air which would be in turn neutralized by the negative ions. An electromagnetic field will only generate ions if the voltage is high enough to cause an electric discharge, and the electromagnetic fields generated by household appliances are not that that strong, per the WHO:\nSome electromagnetic waves carry so much energy per quantum that they have the ability to break bonds between molecules. In the electromagnetic spectrum, gamma rays given off by radioactive materials, cosmic rays and X-rays carry this property and are called \u2018ionizing radiation\u2019. Fields whose quanta are insufficient to break molecular bonds are called \u2018non-ionizing radiation\u2019. Man-made sources of electromagnetic fields that form a major part of industrialized life \u2014 electricity, microwaves and radiofrequency fields \u2014 are found at the relatively long wavelength and low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum and their quanta are unable to break chemical bonds.\nSome electromagnetic waves carry so much energy per quantum that they have the ability to break bonds between molecules.

These machines ionize the air, then attract the dust and other ions created with charged surfaces as air is pushed through the system, thus and removing those particles from the air.\nA block of sodium chloride, which, again, does not produce any ions, does not have any mechanism for the flow of air or the trapping of the particles in that air, and would therefore be useless as an air filtration system. This is, incidentally, why the Sharper Image Ionic Breeze line of products, despite actually producing ions, is complete bunk.\nThe constant intake of negative ions makes your slumber less fitful, and helps you get more out of your rest.\n\u00a0This claim has existed sporadically in the scientific literature for decades, but ultimately is not supported by current science. A 2013 review of psychological effects attributed to air ions, which looked at 33 studies from 1957 to 2012 evaluating \u201cthe effects of air ionization on depression, anxiety, mood states, and subjective feelings of mental well-being\u201d, concluded:\nNo consistent influence of positive or negative air ionization on anxiety, mood, relaxation, sleep, and personal comfort measures was observed.\nNo consistent influence of positive or negative air ionization on anxiety, mood, relaxation, sleep, and personal comfort measures was observed.\nThe ions lower high blood pressure, reducing the chance of heart attacks and strokes.\n\u00a0This claim stems from research performed on laboratory rats who were under anesthesia and essentially pumped directly with high concentrations of negatively ionized air. It goes without saying that humans are not rats, and a that specifically designed laboratory ionization instruments produce a whole lot more ions than a salt lamp, which, not to drive this point home too much, they do not.\nThe salt that is used in these lamps, Himalayan salt, contains up to 84 trace minerals that your body needs, allowing the lamp to also strengthen your bone, regulates your body pH, and balances the water content in your body.\n\u00a0This assertion is perplexing because it is a) unclear where that number comes from, b) which ones they are, or c) how these trace minerals would be released from the salt in a lamp and transported into your body.\nIt seems likely that the number and associated health claims comes from a page on Dr. Mercola\u2019s online store in which he is selling his own brand of Himalayan salt (supplies are limited!) Ironically, Mercola claims Himalayan salt to be \u201cthe most pure\u201d while simultaneously suggesting its health benefits come from its impurities:\nThis salt from the Himalayas is known as \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Together with pure spring water, Himalayan Crystal Salt offers all the natural elements original to its source \u2013 the very same elements originally found existing in the \u201cprimal sea.\u201d\nContaining at least 84 naturally occurring trace elements in their natural mineral form, the benefits of natural Himalayan Crystal Salt include [\u2026]\nThis salt from the Himalayas is known as \u201cwhite gold.\u201d Together with pure spring water, Himalayan Crystal Salt offers all the natural elements original to its source \u2013 the very same elements originally found existing in the \u201cprimal sea.\u201d\nContaining at least 84 naturally occurring trace elements in their natural mineral form, the benefits of natural Himalayan Crystal Salt include [\u2026]\nNeedless to say, the claims listed on an advertisement for a product cannot be taken as peer-reviewed science. Not that you need to even look that far.\nThis advertisement is for salt to cook with, which would provide a much more plausible route for those trace minerals to get into your body. Unless you are licking your salt lamp, however, the only thing those impurities might do is impart its nice pinkish color.\nIncidentally, that nice pinkish color that glows once the bulb is turned on is the only thing you are going to get from a salt lamp. Salt lamps may look neat, but claims that they can do anything medically rely \u2014 fatally \u2014 on the claim that the lamps produce negative ions and then further rely on a series gross simplifications or misinterpretations of science to argue that those negative ions (which don\u2019t exist in the first place) could affect you in any meaningful way."}, "78": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coil-mattresses-cause-cancer-amplifying-radio-waves/", "title": "\tDo Coil Mattresses Cause Cancer by Amplifying Radio Waves?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe misconception that coil mattresses promote cancer came from a 'Scientific American' blog post that interpreted the results of an already wildly speculative paper incorrectly.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["21 December 2016"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/12/spring_mattress_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tCoiled mattresses cause cancer by amplifying radio waves.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nA July 2010 guest post on a Scientific American blog incorrectly reported the results of a Swedish study that, in turn, made the largely speculative hypothesis that some forms of cancer are more frequent on the left side of the body because the right side (which is most people\u2019s preference for a side to sleep on) gets protection from the myriad electromagnetic FM and TV radio waves already present in the environment due to the dampening influence of the metal coils in a mattress. As described in the study\u2019s abstract:\n\nHere we show that a high prevalence of breast cancer and melanoma on the left side of the body may be a logical consequence of sleeping in beds having mattresses containing wave-reflecting metal springs. We found that people tend to sleep for longer periods on their right side, apparently to avoid disturbance by the heartbeat. This puts the left side farther away from the field-attenuating influence of the metal springs in the mattress; thus the left side will spend, on average, more time exposed to stronger combined fields from incident and reflected waves.\n\n\nHere we show that a high prevalence of breast cancer and melanoma on the left side of the body may be a logical consequence of sleeping in beds having mattresses containing wave-reflecting metal springs.

Asleep on these antennas, our bodies are exposed to the amplified electromagnetic radiation for a third of our life spans. As we slumber on a metal coil-spring mattress, a wave of electromagnetic radiation envelops our bodies so that the maximum strength of the field develops 75 centimeters above the mattress in the middle of our bodies. When sleeping on the right side, the body\u2019s left side will thereby be exposed to field strength about twice as strong as what the right side absorbs.\n\n\nThus, as we sleep on our coil-spring mattresses, we are in effect sleeping on an antenna that amplifies the intensity of the broadcast FM/TV radiation.

They also found no preference for either side with respect to cancer in Japanese individuals.\u00a0\nEven though the World Health Organization (WHO) does not consider radio wave transmissions a risk factor for cancer in the first place, the paper presented speculation based on deeply imperfect data with equally imperfect conclusions. It made no direct investigation into the mechanisms its authors proposed.\nMore to the point, however, the claim presented in the Scientific American blog post was not even an accurate portrayal of the authors\u2019 speculative hypothesis. No scientist is actually suggesting that a passive, unelectrified network of coils could somehow amplify a signal without the input of power.\nBut peddlers of pseudoscience and misinformation frequently cite this erroneous analysis (and not the study itself) as evidence for the harms of electromagnetism. Dr. Mercola, prolific purveyor of misinformation and supplements, had this to say about the study (which he clearly did not read): \u201c[Y]our box spring mattress actually acts like an antenna; attracting and amplifying whatever radiation might be zipping through your bedroom.\u201d\nYou may want to lose sleep over a doctor misrepresenting health risks to millions of followers, but you certainly shouldn\u2019t lose any sleep over the radiation-amplifying coils in your unpowered mattress."}, "79": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/will-tonight-be-the-darkest-night-in-500-years/", "title": "\tWill Tonight Be the Darkest Night in 500 Years?", "subtitle": "\t\tA 2010 article about the imminent occurrence of the \"darkest night in 500 years\" and a lunar eclipse circulated as new in 2014 and again in 2016.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tKim LaCapria\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["20 December 2016"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/12/tonight-will-be-the-darkest-night-500-years.jpg", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe \"darkest night in 500 years\" will take place on 20 December 2016 due to a lunar eclipse.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 20 December 2016, Facebook users began sharing a link to an io9 article reporting that \u201ctonight\u201d would be the \u201cdarkest night in 500 years\u201d:\nThanks to a lunar eclipse on the longest night of the year, tonight we\u2019ll be experiencing the longest, darkest night in a very long time.

But once the scouts\u2019 hair was cut to regulation military length, they lost their preternatural tracking skills. Later tests showed that long, flowing hair was an essential component of those skills:\n\nIt seems that during the Vietnam War special forces in the war department had sent undercover experts to comb American Indian Reservations looking for talented scouts, for tough young men trained to move stealthily through rough terrain. They were especially looking for men with outstanding, almost supernatural, tracking abilities. Before being approached, these carefully selected men were extensively documented as experts in tracking and survival \u2026\nOnce enlisted, an amazing thing happened.

Logical fallacies notwithstanding, the confirmable facts are that numerous Native American soldiers served in Vietnam, a large majority of whom volunteered for their service before being drafted and were integrated into regular units, and no historical accounts exist of specialized scouting units composed of long-haired Native American soldiers.\nWe reached out to the military regarding the possibility that such a program may have occurred, and F. Lee Reynolds with the United States Army Center of Military History provided us with the following statement:\n\nWe reviewed your request to validate or not validate the story on Native American Scouts in Vietnam. We did not find any information (official or unofficial) here to acknowledge the information is correct so we reached out to our historians with Army Special Forces to see if there was a local program conducted by Special Forces.

This setup makes a good deal more sense relative to the Native American claim, given the Viet Cong\u2019s actual knowledge of the land and its inhabitants.\nThe scientific claims are no less dubious. While it is borderline accurate to say that hair plays a role in the nervous system, that does not mean it serves as some sort of \u201cantenna\u201d into the ineffable aspects of our own consciousness. The reality is a bit less grandiose, according to the New England Journal of Medicine:\n\nThe hair follicle acts as a sensory organ and immunologic sentinel for the skin. Hairs detect mechanical stimuli above the surface of the skin, and the slightest bend in a hair activates neuroreceptors in the follicle, relaying important sensory information to the nervous system. The Langerhans\u2019 cells at the opening of the follicle detect surface pathogens and activate the immune system.\n\n\nThe hair follicle acts as a sensory organ and immunologic sentinel for the skin.

The Langerhans\u2019 cells at the opening of the follicle detect surface pathogens and activate the immune system.\n\nIn other words, the two primary functions hair has on a sensory level are to signal physical movement of the hair and to detect pathogens. In both cases, however, it is not the hair itself that is talking to the nervous or immune systems, but the cells of the follicle to which the hair is attached. It is unclear how the subtle movement of one\u2019s hair or the ability to detect pathogens via the scalp would have any bearing on scouting in the Vietnam War.\nThe original article on this subject went on to claim that hair both emits and receives electromagnetic signals to and from the brain:\n\nNot only does hair in people, including facial hair in men, provide an information highway reaching the brain, hair also emits energy, the electromagnetic energy emitted by the brain into the outer environment. This has been seen in Kirlian photography when a person is photographed with long hair and then rephotographed after the hair is cut.\nWhen hair is cut, receiving and sending transmissions to and from the environment are greatly hampered. This results in \u2018numbing-out\u2019.\n\n\nNot only does hair in people, including facial hair in men, provide an information highway reaching the brain, hair also emits energy, the electromagnetic energy emitted by the brain into the outer environment.

Hair is a terrible conductor of electricity and is actually comparable in electrical resistivity to rubber, which commonly used to protect against the flow of an electric current. Other less well-defined terms such \u201cintuition\u201d are harder to refute, but it should be noted that not a single version of this story provided any sort of mechanism outside of the implausible and vague notion of electromagnetic signals.\nKirlian photography, the only piece of \u201cevidence\u201d provided for the nebulous claim of hair as an intuition antenna, is a common topic on new age, alternative health, and metaphysical websites. In broad terms, it is a collection of techniques used to photograph an electric field, which new age and alternative health practitioners sometimes describe as an \u201caura\u201d that is medically or spiritually informative.\nScience finds no support for such a claim, however. Any differences in a before/after photographs of hair would almost certainly represent nothing more than the moisture content of the hair or lack thereof, as later studies into the topic revealed.\nAs Native American writer and creator of the blog \u201cNative Skeptic\u201d Noah Nez wrote on a post for the Center for Inquiry, hair plays an important role in many tribes\u2019 religious beliefs, but those views have often been co-opted by various New Age movements:\n\nClose investigation into various tribal beliefs might help explain the origin of this story. Though Native American legends and belief systems do incorporate terms for the supernatural, they do not use phrases found in New Age mysticism like \u201caura\u201d or \u201csixth sense\u201d \u2026 While there might be some variability in the details regarding the reasons for long hair from tribe to tribe, there is one major component that has remained consistent: long hair has never been about aesthetics but instead is a religious concern.\n\n\nClose investigation into various tribal beliefs might help explain the origin of this story.

Not a single piece of historical evidence supports the claims of Native American scout recruitment by the U.S. military, and no scientific evidence that holds up to any level of scrutiny supports  the idea of heightened intuition resulting from longer hair."}, "81": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ben-carson-thinks-the-earth-would-have-exploded-during-big-bang/", "title": "\tBen Carson Thinks the Earth Would Have Exploded During Big Bang", "subtitle": "\t\tWhile Carson does not buy into the theory of the Big Bang origin of our cosmos, a viral meme misrepresents Carson\u2019s view on the topic.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["27 November 2016"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/11/8570164791_555226eb60_k.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tBen Carson once said \u201cif the Big Bang is merely a theory, if by chance it was true, how would you explain that the Earth didn't blow up during the explosion?\u201d\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn November 2016, a viral meme circulated on social media in the wake of the announcement that Ben Carson was being considered for the job of President-elect Trump\u2019s Education Secretary (which he allegedly declined), suggesting that the former Republican presidential candidate\u00a0didn\u2019t believe in the Big Bang theory because it would have destroyed Earth.\nBen Carson, as far as we can tell, never actually made this statement.

Though some theories of the origin of the universe suggest that the Big Bang was only one of many such explosions, these theories do not state that the currently ordered existence is a spontaneous result of one of these repeated Big Bangs. Greene called this a \u201cred herring,\u201d and said the concept of multiple Big Bangs has nothing to do with how stars and planets form in this current universe. Instead, those theories involve the idea that the universe goes through cycles over many billions of years: Big Bang, expansion, contraction, \u201cBig Crunch,\u201d followed by another Big Bang.

For thousands of years the Schumann Resonance or pulse (heartbeat) of Earth has been 7.83 cycles per second, The military have used this as a very reliable reference.

Schumann resonances are ultra low frequency waves in the upper atmosphere caused, in essence, by Earth\u2019s constant hum of lightning strikes, as described by NASA:\n\nEvery second, lightning flashes some 50 times on Earth. Together these discharges coalesce and get stronger, creating electromagnetic waves circling around Earth, to create a beating pulse between the ground and the lower ionosphere, about 60 miles up in the atmosphere. This electromagnetic signature [is] known as Schumann Resonance [\u2026]\n\nEvery second, lightning flashes some 50 times on Earth.

This electromagnetic signature [is] known as Schumann Resonance [\u2026]\nThis constant low frequency wave is popularly thought of as the heartbeat of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and it is composed of numerous frequency waves, the most prominent being commonly defined as 7.8 Hz.\nThe notion that this \u2018pulse\u2019 is speeding up and appears to originate from new age author Gregg Braden, who was a big advocate of the theory that the magnetic poles would\u00a0reverse in the year 2012, and who is described on his publisher\u2019s website with these accolades:\n\nFor more than 27 years, Gregg has explored high mountain villages, remote monasteries, and forgotten texts to merge their timeless secrets.

In this article, however, we will dissect the Health Ranger\u2019s argument strictly based on his flawed understanding of natural selection. To begin with, here is how he describes the characteristics of the two populations whose biological fitness he claims to be comparing:\n\nPolitical conservatives tend to be practical, real-world people, while political leftists tend to be delusional snowflakes living in artificial worlds that run on fragile, psycho-babble constructs that fall apart at the merest touch.\nDonald Trump is a competitive, adaptive survivor. So am I, and so are tens of millions of gun owners, police officers, fire fighters, EMTs, paramedics, outdoorsmen, hunters, inventors and business entrepreneurs. These are the kind of people who are fighters and problem solvers. They don\u2019t curl up into pathetic sobbing balls of whimpering slobber when things don\u2019t go their way. Instead, they regroup, rethink the problem and start kicking ass in a new way to overcome and succeed.\n\n\nPolitical conservatives tend to be practical, real-world people, while political leftists tend to be delusional snowflakes living in artificial worlds that run on fragile, psycho-babble constructs that fall apart at the merest touch.\nDonald Trump is a competitive, adaptive survivor.

Instead, they regroup, rethink the problem and start kicking ass in a new way to overcome and succeed.\n\nDiscounting the aggressively broad generalizations of both sides, we\u2019ll turn to the science supposedly expressed here. What follows is Adams\u2019 understanding of natural selection:\n\nNatural selection is a process by which the weaker, more fragile and less adaptive members of any species are killed off or denied reproductive partners. This weeds them out of the gene pool of the species, resulting in a stronger, more adaptive and more successful species that can survive a challenging, competitive world.\n\n\nNatural selection is a process by which the weaker, more fragile and less adaptive members of any species are killed off or denied reproductive partners. This weeds them out of the gene pool of the species, resulting in a stronger, more adaptive and more successful species that can survive a challenging, competitive world.\n\nIn his view of natural selection, which, we will grant, is close to (but falls short of) being accurate, the process results in millennial snowflake liberals who are less fit because they don\u2019t possess the following traits that \u201care universal across the natural world\u201d:\n\n#1) COMPETITION: In competition, there are winners and losers. Winners get to live and pass their genes to the next generation. Losers die and are removed from the gene pool.\n#2) ADAPTATION: Successful organisms in any population show strong adaptive capabilities to handle challenging stresses that require alteration of the organism\u2019s goals or strategies to survive and thrive.\n#3) STRONG MALES = SUCCESSFUL OFFSPRING: In mammals and many other types of living organisms, those males which are the strongest at protecting their families and beating out other competing males for reproductive rights are rewarded with genetic influence over the next generation of youth to be born.

[\u2026]\n\nThe issue, though, is that these three traits are far from universal in the natural world. On his first point, we can obviously agree with\u00a0Adams that competition is a key part of natural selection. But do populations of organisms feature ruthless competition between members? No.\nIn what could easily be branded as an example of the natural world\u2019s version of the liberal welfare state, skilled vampire bat predators will give nourishment, unreciprocated, to those less able to feed themselves. A 2013 paper published by Proceedings of the Royal Society documented this behavior over a two-year period, finding that donors who offered the food to the recipients without prompting, and that this action occurred independent of kinship. The phenomenon is important, the authors argue, because:\n\nVampire bat food sharing is potentially a powerful model for understanding the cognitive enforcement of cooperation, because this behaviour is completely natural, energetically costly, [and] occurs between kin and non-kin.\n\n\nVampire bat food sharing is potentially a powerful model for understanding the cognitive enforcement of cooperation, because this behaviour is completely natural, energetically costly, [and] occurs between kin and non-kin.\n\nAdams\u2019 second point about the need to be \u201cadaptive\u201d to one\u2019s environment results from a flawed reading of Darwin. When proposing his theory of natural selection, Adams repeatedly suggests:\n\nSuccessful organisms in any population show strong adaptive capabilities to handle challenging stresses that require alteration of the organism\u2019s goals or strategies to survive and thrive.\n\n\nSuccessful organisms in any population show strong adaptive capabilities to handle challenging stresses that require alteration of the organism\u2019s goals or strategies to survive and thrive.\n\nAdaptations are, of course, a big part of natural selection, but what Darwin was referring to in this case were genetically determined features of an organism, set at birth, that would give it a reproductive advantage \u2014 not the specific characteristic \u201cadaptability\u201d to rapidly changing environments, as Darwin stated in On the Origin of Species:\n\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents\u2014and a cause for each must exist\u2014it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure.\n\n\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents\u2014and a cause for each must exist\u2014it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure.\n\nAdams\u2019 third point is a common rallying cry among those who argue that a patriarchal society is the only social structure existing in the natural world. The problem, of course, is that there are myriad animals, including primates, that live in female-dominant social structures all around the natural world. A small selection of those animals are listed in a 2008 study published in the journal Animal Behavior:\n\nContrary to common conceptions portrayed in the literature, female dominance over males appears to be widespread among mammals and birds showing sexual size monomorphism. Female dominance has been reported for several nonprimate mammals with similar-sized sexes, including the hyrax (Procavia capensis), spotted hyena, rufous elephant shrew (Elephantus rufescens), velvet-furred swamp rat (Rattus lutreolus), brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), and nutria (Myocastor coypus).\n\n\nContrary to common conceptions portrayed in the literature, female dominance over males appears to be widespread among mammals and birds showing sexual size monomorphism.

For example, he believes that liberal female college students don\u2019t need to be selective in their choice of mates because of their easy access to abortions:\n\nFemale college students don\u2019t even have to be selective in their choice of possible sex mates because they always have abortion at the ready to remove any child that might start to form in their wombs. Thus, easy access to abortion services makes females \u201clazy\u201d in their choice of reproductive partners, resulting in a kind of \u201cbackward evolution\u201d force that drives humanity downward rather than forward.\n\n\nFemale college students don\u2019t even have to be selective in their choice of possible sex mates because they always have abortion at the ready to remove any child that might start to form in their wombs. Thus, easy access to abortion services makes females \u201clazy\u201d in their choice of reproductive partners, resulting in a kind of \u201cbackward evolution\u201d force that drives humanity downward rather than forward.\nIf anything, the opposite is true. Abortion rates and unplanned pregnancies have been declining since the Reagan administration of the 1980s, a fact researchers attribute to contraception, something college students generally have better access to than the population at large. This would put females explicitly in charge of whom they would want to have procreative sex with, making them (from an evolutionary standpoint) more selective.\nAnother specious notion is the concept of a \u201cnatural selection event.\u201d This is not a thing. Natural selection happens all the time, a point explicitly and poetically made by Darwin:\n\nIt may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapses of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.\n\n\nIt may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapses of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.\n\nThe final and perhaps most alarming issue with Adams\u2019 conception of natural selection is his omission of the fact that any trait selected for has to be heritable, which means it is controlled by genetics and is able to be passed on through reproduction.\nWhile there there is some evidence from studies that genetic differences can be found between people of different ideological persuasions, these studies are limited in their ability to tell us much about what specific aspects of ideology are hereditary.\nA 2012 review article on this topic by Peter K. Hatemi and Rose McDermott published in Trends in Genetics concluded that genetics may account for a significant portion of political persuasion, but that the manner in which genetics controlled specific issues was not consistent (i.e., some issues appeared to be more genetically determined than others) and played a much smaller role in actually determining political party affiliation. The study also pushed back against the simplistic notion that there is a \u201cliberal\u201d gene and a \u201cconservative\u201d gene:\n\nCertainly, there is not a gene for liberalism or any political trait. Rather, whatever genetic influences exist probably operate through those emotional, cognitive, or rational processes that are instigated when individuals are asked particular questions about their attitudes. \nSome combination of mutation, genetic drift, assortative mating, recombination, culture, institutions, social learning, experience, and ecological adaptation drives variance on these traits. The manifestation of genetic influence on these preferences appears more complicated because of large scale societies, institutions, and modern social structures, such as states and governments. The labels and meanings of issues, groups, and policies might change across time and cultures.\n\n\nCertainly, there is not a gene for liberalism or any political trait.

It is unlikely that he would be able to find studies addressing the genetic basis of qualities like being \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201cpussified\u201d, \u201cmetrosexual\u201d, having an \u201ceverybody\u2019s a winner\u201d or \u201creal-world\u201d mentality, or having the desire for \u201cfeel good social conformity\u201d.\nArguably, Adams actually delves into the discredited and archaic theory of Lamarckism, which suggests that an organism can pass on characteristics that it has acquired during its lifetime to its offspring when he claims that parents inflicting liberal ideals upon their offspring will doom their genetic line:\n\nTeaching your child liberalism is, then, a form of genetic homicide against future generations, because when your pathetic, loser \u201csnowflake\u201d children are wiped out at the next natural selection event, your family tree gets cut off at the stump.\n\n\nTeaching your child liberalism is, then, a form of genetic homicide against future generations, because when your pathetic, loser \u201csnowflake\u201d children are wiped out at the next natural selection event, your family tree gets cut off at the stump.\n\nSure, Adams\u2019 piece is meant to be political and is potentially even a poorly-executed attempt at satire (though his followers probably don\u2019t see it that way), but it was published on a site that bills itself as \u201ca science-based natural health advocacy organization,\u201d and it is riddled with scientific errors in an effort to make a largely inflammatory (if not incoherent) point.\nThe larger fallacy that Adams is committing is the serious problem: abusing scientific information to convince people that the natural world supports your version of humanity and that people who don\u2019t fit that view are, as Adams put it, \u201clittle more than aberrations of nature.\u201d"}, "84": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/monsanto-suppressing-evidence-of-cancerous-herbicide-in-food/", "title": "\tIs Monsanto Suppressing Evidence of a Cancerous Herbicide in Food?", "subtitle": "\t\tA laboratory test performed by food activists went viral, but its results and the allegations drawn from them were not reliable.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["16 November 2016"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2016/11/26673445341_4b33544830_k.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA new analysis of the residue on common American foods showed high levels of the herbicide glyphosate and Monsanto, the EPA, and the FDA are in cahoots to silence word of the chemical\u2019s harmful effects and its high concentration in foods.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nNote:\u00a0On 10 August 2018, a jury assembled in California Superior Court in San Francisco found Monsanto (which is now part of the pharmaceutical company Bayer) liable for a 46-year-old groundskeeper\u2019s development of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For more information on that ruling, and how it relates to glyphosate residue in food, please read our August 2018\u00a0explainer on that case.\u00a0\nOn 15 November 2016, the natural food evangelist and alternative health guru known as the Food Babe posted a report from a natural food activist group named Food Democracy Now that alleged to demonstrate common American foods contain high levels of glyphosate, a chemical in Monsanto\u2019s RoundUp herbicide and the most prevalent weed-killer on the planet.\nHer post and the report it highlights are a new addition to the contentious political debate about the chemical\u2019s harm to humans and the environment, as well as the potential influence of large companies like Monsanto on regulatory agencies, that has been ongoing for decades.\nGlyphosate is widely applied to crops around the world \u2014 especially genetically modified crops specifically bred to be resistant to the chemical, per the National Pesticide Information Center:\nGlyphosate is an herbicide. It is applied to the leaves of plants to kill both broadleaf plants and grasses. The sodium salt form of glyphosate is used to regulate plant growth and ripen fruit. Glyphosate was first registered for use in the U.S. in 1974. Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides in the United States. People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants.\nGlyphosate is an herbicide.

People apply it in agriculture and forestry, on lawns and gardens, and for weeds in industrial areas. Some products containing glyphosate control aquatic plants.\nRegulatory agencies have gone back and forth on its safety ever since it was registered for use. The idea, which has been verified by\u00a0observations, is that glyphosate runs off into the water supply, where it can be ingested directly, or consumed after it leaves a residue on food.\nThe first assessment of glyphosate\u2019s carcinogenic potential was undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1985. Based on studies done primarily with rodents, they classified the chemical as \u201ca Group C (Possibly Carcinogenic to Humans: Agents with limited animal evidence and little or no human data) carcinogen\u201d in 1986. After a series of additional investigations, which included industry sponsored studies, the EPA reclassified the chemical in 1993 as \u201cGroup E carcinogen (signifies evidence of non-carcinogenicity in humans).\u201d\nA majority of the data used to demonstrate evidence of harm comes from studies in which environmentally unrealistic concentrations of glyphosate were exposed to rats, mice, and fish. Some recent studies have demonstrated potentially\u00a0adverse effects at low exposure levels but the validity of these results have been called into question by other researchers. \nAlthough a March 2015 review by the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer suggested glyphosate may have some carcinogenic potential, the current consensus amongst the world\u2019s regulatory agencies is that it is safe for consumption and non-carcinogenic at environmentally relevant levels, with the WHO concluding:\nGlyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.\nGlyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through the diet.\nStill, a 2014 report from the US Government Accountability Office compelled the FDA to set up an initiative to monitor food for glyphosate residue, a decision met by praise by environmentalists and food activists. As reported by the Huffington Post\u2019s Carey Gillam, however, the effort was halted due to a lack of agreement on standardizing the analyses:\nThe FDA\u2019s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year. But the glyphosate testing has been particularly challenging for the FDA. The agency was finally forced to put the glyphosate residue testing part of the work plan on hold amid confusion, disagreement and difficulties with establishing a standard methodology to use across the agency\u2019s multiple U.S. laboratories, according to FDA sources. Equipment issues have also been a problem, with some labs citing a need for more sensitive instruments, sources within FDA said.\nThe FDA\u2019s residue testing for glyphosate was combined with a broader herbicides analysis program the FDA set in motion in February of this year.

Based primarily on the fact that the FDA canceled its residue testing program, along with results from various studies performed on animals, she alleges a nefarious connection between the FDA and Monsanto, the developer of the RoundUp:\nWhen it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided to suspend their testing this week. Could it be that Monsanto didn\u2019t like the results they started getting \u2013 especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.\nWhen it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either.

Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins at really low levels of exposure \u2013 at only 0.1 ppb of glyphosate. Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider \u201csafe\u201d.\nA FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsanto\u2019s Roundup) and found ALARMING amounts.

Many foods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulators throughout the world consider \u201csafe\u201d.\nThe statement about 0.1 ppb being the lower limit for harm to human health is controversial, as only one of the studies listed as providing support for that claim actually tested an amount that low; the test was performed on mice, not humans, and it used the word \u201cpotential\u201d, not \u201cprobable\u201d.\nIt is also important to note that many of the results they reported are actually marked with the note that they\u00a0\u201cmay not represent an accurate representation of the sample.\u201d\nThe lab\u00a0results commissioned by Food Democracy Now claimed to show residue values on common American foods that were well above 0.1 ppb; but the methods employed are not elucidated, and its important to remember that the FDA limit is four orders of magnitude greater than the threshold they claim.\nA final point to note is that the report was commissioned by two groups with a stated agenda, as declared in its introduction:\n\nThe testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate.\n\nThe testing and analysis was performed at the request of FOOD DEMOCRACY NOW!, in coordination with THE DETOX PROJECT, which gathered additional scientific evidence from around the world and included a compendium of independent research on glyphosate.\nAccording to their website, \u201cFood Democracy Now! is a grassroots community dedicated to building a sustainable food system that protects our natural environment, sustains farmers and nourishes families.\u201d\nThe Detox Project is a research initiative that is currently focused specifically on glyphosate, according to their mission statement:\nGlyphosate, the world\u2019s most used herbicide, is the first chemical being tested by The Detox Project.

While scientists and regulators have and continue to debate methods for assessing and testing potential harm from glyphosate, the broad scientific consensus is that it is not a risk; and the un-reviewed results of a questionable laboratory exercise do not change that assessment.\nNOTE: This story has been updated based on discussions with a number of scientists in the field.

According to conspiracy site UFOsightinghotspot, research from their study concluded the huge tremors are more likely to wreak havoc during full and new moons.\n\nSupermoons occur when the Moon is simultaneously full and at the closest point to Earth in its orbit (a phenomenon known as perigee). As reported by NASA, the supermoon on 14 November 2016 will be the largest one (i.e., the one in which the moon approaches closest to Earth) since 1948 and will not be surpassed until 2032.\nThe information about the connection between earthquakes and lunar cycles is less set in stone, so to speak. The paper the conspiracy post references is an authentic study published in the 12 September 2016 issue of the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. In that paper\u2019s introduction, the scientists noted that the possible correlation between seismic activity and lunar cycles has been a long-standing debate in seismology:\n\nThe possibility of tidal triggering of earthquakes has been investigated since the 19th century, and numerous studies have examined this topic. Statistically significant correlations between seismicity and tidal stress have been discovered using large data sets, but the correlations are generally limited to special regions or circumstances.\n\nThe possibility of tidal triggering of earthquakes has been investigated since the 19th century, and numerous studies have examined this topic. Statistically significant correlations between seismicity and tidal stress have been discovered using large data sets, but the correlations are generally limited to special regions or circumstances.\nThis study added to that body of research by investigating stress caused by the tidal pull of the moon prior to a number of major earthquakes worldwide, as reported by the Washington Post\u2019s Sarah Kaplan:\n\nThe same gravitational influence that the moon has on the oceans may also trigger earthquakes along Earth\u2019s most fragile faults. Researchers at the University of Tokyo calculated the levels of \u201ctidal stress\u201d before major earthquakes of the past few decades and found that high levels of stress were often followed by major earthquakes.\n\n\nThe same gravitational influence that the moon has on the oceans may also trigger earthquakes along Earth\u2019s most fragile faults. Researchers at the University of Tokyo calculated the levels of \u201ctidal stress\u201d before major earthquakes of the past few decades and found that high levels of stress were often followed by major earthquakes.\n\nAs noted by the researchers, these periods of stress would be most marked during either a full moon or a new moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are generally aligned (an orbital arrangement known as a syzygy). In the researcher\u2019s model of how tidal stress and earthquakes might interact, those periods of high stress make it more likely that minor, deeper fractures will propagate into larger catastrophic events:\n\nThis suggests that the probability of a tiny rock failure expanding to a gigantic rupture increases with increasing tidal stress levels. We conclude that large earthquakes are more probable during periods of high tidal stress.\n\n\nThis suggests that the probability of a tiny rock failure expanding to a gigantic rupture increases with increasing tidal stress levels. We conclude that large earthquakes are more probable during periods of high tidal stress.\n\nThis conclusion is a far cry from the reported suggestion that the 14 November  supermoon, specifically, will cause \u201ctidal\u201d waves and earthquakes, as the study did not make a single mention of these events. The study is also still preliminary:\n\n\u201cThe results are plausible,\u201d University of Washington seismologist John Vidale told Nature. Vidale was not involved in the research; in fact, he previously helped debunk studies claiming a more tenuous connection between earthquakes and tides.\nBut the connection still needs to be verified. Scientists point out that many large earthquakes of the past decade have happened at times when tidal stress wasn\u2019t a factor. Whether the phase of the moon can truly help predict large earthquakes remains to be seen.\n\n\n\u201cThe results are plausible,\u201d University of Washington seismologist John Vidale told Nature.

Whether the phase of the moon can truly help predict large earthquakes remains to be seen.\n\nFurthermore, the difference in tidal stress caused between a supermoon alignment and a run-of-the-mill syzygy (which occur at periodicities of 14.8 days) is probably negligible since tidal forces themselves are fairly minor, as discussed by Bad Astronomy\u2019s Phil Plait:\n\nThe bullet points are that the Sun has an effect on our tides here on Earth, as does the Moon. When the Sun, Earth, and Moon are near a straight line in space \u2014 that is, at new or full Moon \u2014 these effects are maximized. We get what are called spring tides, with extra-high high tides, and extra-low low tides.\nIf this happens at perigee, the effects are even stronger. The tidal force from the Moon can be as much as 50% greater! While that sounds dangerous, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ll see huge earthquakes and roaring tidal waves from this, because even at their strongest, the tidal forces are fairly weak.\n\n\nThe bullet points are that the Sun has an effect on our tides here on Earth, as does the Moon.

The Earth has stored a tremendous amount of internal energy within its thin outer shell or crust, and the small differences in the tidal forces exerted by the moon (and sun) are not enough to fundamentally overcome the much larger forces within the planet due to convection (and other aspects of the internal energy balance that drives plate tectonics).\n\n\nThe effects on Earth from a supermoon are minor, and according to the most detailed studies by terrestrial seismologists and volcanologists, the combination of the moon being at its closest to Earth in its orbit, and being in its \u2018full moon\u2019 configuration (relative to the Earth and sun), should not affect the internal energy balance of the Earth since there are lunar tides every day.

The change reported in this new study results from tempering that earlier projection. However, life expectancies are still expected to rise across the board, just at a slower rate than was predicted in 2015.\nThis lagging rate of improvement to mortality rates in the United States compared to other developed nations is a well-documented observation with no single, widely accepted answer.

As a benchmark for this magnitude, the NCHS estimates that eliminating all cancer deaths would increase life expectancy at birth by 3.2 years.\nThis same\u00a0study,\u00a0which uses data as recent as the SOA report, suggested that insurance access in the lowest income bracket did not appear to play a role in determining life expectancy:\n\nMeasures of health insurance coverage and spending (the fraction of uninsured and risk-adjusted Medicare spending per enrollee) were not significantly associated with life expectancy for individuals in the bottom income quartile.\n\nMeasures of health insurance coverage and spending (the fraction of uninsured and risk-adjusted Medicare spending per enrollee) were not significantly associated with life expectancy for individuals in the bottom income quartile.\nWhat these detailed studies of mortality rates suggest is that treating longevity predictors as a single number based on age and gender masks their more nuanced realities, which impedes efforts to identify any cause (or causes) for potential changes to them.\nThe goal of the SOA report was not to identify a cause, but to create an improved algorithm to allow pension funds to estimate how long their clients might be alive, based on the most recent data from the Social Security Administration.\nA final flaw in the Natural News-insinuated link between Obamacare and lower-than-expected improvements to life expectancy predictions is that the most recent data the SOA used was from the early months of 2014, and most of the\u00a0changes to its earlier assessment came from the addition of data from 2012 and 2013.\nIt is unclear, based on the Natural News story, what specific mechanisms of the ACA\u2019s rollout would have affected mortality rates.

That author\u2019s main claim was well summarized by the first two sentences of the article:\n\nA biological research team at Bielefeld University has made a groundbreaking discovery showing that plants can draw an alternative source of energy from other plants.

This finding could also have a major impact on the future of bioenergy eventually providing the evidence to show that people draw energy from others in much the same way.\n\nThis article distorted the findings of an actual scientific study about a species of green algae called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. That research, published in the journal Nature Communications on 20 November 2012, demonstrated that, in addition to photosynthesis, this species of green algae, under sub-optimal growing conditions, can derive energy by breaking down and consuming the cellulose (the main molecule of a green plant\u2019s cell walls) of other nearby plants, as  reported in a Universitaet Bielefeld press release:\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that such a behaviour has been confirmed in a vegetable organism,\u201d says Professor Kruse. \u201cThat algae can digest cellulose contradicts every previous textbook. To a certain extent, what we are seeing is plants eating plants.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that such a behaviour has been confirmed in a vegetable organism,\u201d says Professor Kruse. \u201cThat algae can digest cellulose contradicts every previous textbook. To a certain extent, what we are seeing is plants eating plants.\u201d\n\nThe paper also speculated that this technology could be used to convert cellulose waste (e.g. crops, paper, etc.) into a form of carbon that could be used as a biofuel, a process that currently relies on a type of fungi that needs additional sources of energy to grow.\nThe press release continued on to speculate that \u201cIf, in future, cellulose enzymes can be obtained from algae, there would be no more need for the organic material to feed the fungi.\u201d\nIn the case of the Simple Capacity viral story, the major leap from the scientific study to pseudoscience occurred when \u201cpsychologist and energy healer\u201d Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee (who may be a fictional character created for the purpose of promoting this one claim) commented on the study.\nThe logic of the transition was not subtle:\n\nFlowers need water and light to grow and people are no different. Our physical bodies are like sponges, soaking up the environment. \u201cThis is exactly why there are certain people who feel uncomfortable in specific group settings where there is a mix of energy and emotions,\u201d said psychologist and energy healer Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee.\n\n\nFlowers need water and light to grow and people are no different.

That\u2019s why being around nature is often uplifting and energizing for so many people,\u201d she concluded.\n\n\nBader-Lee suggests that the field of bioenergy is now ever evolving and that studies on the plant and animal world will soon translate and demonstrate what energy metaphysicians have known all along \u2014 that humans can heal each other simply through energy transfer just as plants do. \u201cHuman can absorb and heal through other humans, animals, and any part of nature.

The algae literally consume the physical organic matter of other plants, not some unseen, untapped metaphysical form of energy. The analogous concept for humans would be cannibalism.\nTo be consistent with the study, humans would also be required to be built of cellulose (which we are not), as the algae\u2019s mechanism for deriving energy from other plants is to produce an enzyme that breaks down the cellulose and converts it into a form that can be consumed by its own cells.\nThis viral news story was a prime example of a poorly executed bait and switch.

One quote, from Arizona State University climatologist Randall Cerveny, explained the mechanics of a downburst while putting the term \u201cair bomb\u201d into play:\n\nThese types of hexagonal shapes over the ocean are in essence air bombs. They are formed by what are called microbursts and they\u2019re blasts of air that come down out of the bottom of a cloud and then hit the ocean and then create waves that can sometimes be massive in size as they start to interact with each other.\n\n\nThese types of hexagonal shapes over the ocean are in essence air bombs.

Most of the time, clouds are random in their distribution.\nBoth statements are factual. However, neither scientist claimed that the mechanism they were describing had any explanatory power for the purported anomalous number of disappearances of ships and planes in the area. In a 21 October 2016 USA Today article, both scientists suggested their comments had been misrepresented by the Science Channel:\n\nSteven Miller, who appeared on the Science Channel report, said this weather pattern can\u2019t be blamed for Bermuda Triangle disappearances, because it happens everywhere.\n\u201cIt is a common phenomenon occurring globally\u2014most generally found at mid- to high latitude locations over the oceans, and usually during the cold season,\u201d the scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere of Colorado State University said.\nRandy Cerveny, who also appeared in the report, said he was surprised with the piece because he hasn\u2019t done any original work on this topic and was speculating the weather pattern might be explained by concentrated downbursts of air from decaying thunderstorms.\n\u201cThey made it appear as if I was making a big breakthrough or something,\u201d Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University, said. \u201cSadly [that\u2019s] not the case.\u201d\n\n\nSteven Miller, who appeared on the Science Channel report, said this weather pattern can\u2019t be blamed for Bermuda Triangle disappearances, because it happens everywhere.\n\u201cIt is a common phenomenon occurring globally\u2014most generally found at mid- to high latitude locations over the oceans, and usually during the cold season,\u201d the scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere of Colorado State University said.\nRandy Cerveny, who also appeared in the report, said he was surprised with the piece because he hasn\u2019t done any original work on this topic and was speculating the weather pattern might be explained by concentrated downbursts of air from decaying thunderstorms.\n\u201cThey made it appear as if I was making a big breakthrough or something,\u201d Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University, said. \u201cSadly [that\u2019s] not the case.\u201d\n\nAny physical explanation for an anomalous number of disappearances in a specific area should have, as a defining characteristic, something that makes it unique to that area. The hexagonal cloud explanation fails to meet this low bar, a point made by Miller and reinforced by the same USA Today story:\n\nSatellite weather images showing honeycomb cloud patterns, like those above the Bermuda Triangle, are strange to see, but not uncommon. These open and closed cells occur when cold, dry air mixes over warm water.\nThe patterns are usually spotted over the mid-North Atlantic and the North Pacific during late fall to early spring. A Science Channel report linking the weather phenomenon to the Bermuda Triangle speculates the cloud patterns, which can create updrafts and downdrafts, could be responsible for unusual activity there.\n\n\nSatellite weather images showing honeycomb cloud patterns, like those above the Bermuda Triangle, are strange to see, but not uncommon.

A deeply researched 1975 book by Lawrence Kusche looked at the records of many of the so-called disappearances and found them to be questionable, inaccurately reported, or embellished.\nIn 2013, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) issued an exhaustive  study of the most dangerous shipping regions in the world\u2019s oceans.

He reiterated his frustration over having his photographs published without his permission in a message to us, and also expressed dismay over the purpose they were used for:\nWith the culture of digital photography and photos with smartphones, it is common to think that a photo has no value.

While the blog highlighted Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) alongside autism as reported adverse effects, directly beneath the referenced passage was information that the rate of SIDS was lower among vaccinated infants than among unvaccinated ones:\nIn the German case-control study and US open-label safety study in which 14,971 infants received Tripedia vaccine, 13 deaths in Tripedia vaccine recipients were reported. Causes of deaths included seven SIDS, and one of each of the following: enteritis, Leigh Syndrome, adrenogenital syndrome, cardiac arrest, motor vehicle accident, and accidental drowning. All of these events occurred more than two weeks post immunization. The rate of SIDS observed in the German case-control study was 0.4/1,000 vaccinated infants. The rate of SIDS observed in the US open-label safety study was 0.8/1,000 vaccinated infants and the reported rate of SIDS in the US from 1985-1991 was 1.5/1,000 live births. By chance alone, some cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of whole-cell pertussis DTP35 or DTaP vaccines.\nIn the German case-control study and US open-label safety study in which 14,971 infants received Tripedia vaccine, 13 deaths in Tripedia vaccine recipients were reported.

By chance alone, some cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of whole-cell pertussis DTP35 or DTaP vaccines.\nAnother aspect of the vaccine excerpt reproduced above was that automobile accidents and drownings were included among the causes of reported deaths that occurred after vaccination, which\u00a0underscores\u00a0that the nature of such statistics is an inclusive one encompassing adverse events which clearly have no causal relationship with vaccine.\nReiss also pointed us to the FDA\u2019s guidance on adverse event-related drug labeling [PDF], which states:\nThe ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials and must also be preceded by information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions. To help practitioners interpret the significance of data obtained from postmarketing spontaneous reports, the following statement, or an appropriate modification, should precede these data:\nContains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug X. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.\nThe ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports.

It actually says so.\u201d\nThose who read down to the bottom of the eleven-page Tripedia/DTaP insert might have noticed another relevant portion:\nThe insert information was labeled current \u201cas of December 2005,\u201d which first would mean its sudden \u201cdiscovery\u201d by an anonymous blogger over a decade later was of questionable (if not negligible) import. But the age of the documentation was important for a second reason: the prominent medical journal The Lancet didn\u2019t formally retract a controversial 1998 research paper which falsely advanced the belief that vaccines were linked to autism until February 2010. While that retraction was significant and definitive, twelve years passed between the paper\u2019s publication and The\u00a0Lancet\u2018s disavowal of it:\nA prominent British medical journal retracted a 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Britain after the paper\u2019s lead author suggested that vaccines could cause autism.\nThe retraction by The Lancet is part of a reassessment that has lasted for years of the scientific methods and financial conflicts of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research showed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may be unsafe.\nTom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the retraction of Dr. Wakefield\u2019s study \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\u201cIt builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world\u2019s leading scientists that concludes there is no link between M.M.R. vaccine and autism,\u201d Mr. Skinner wrote.\nA British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for the suffering of children involved in his research.\nDr. Wakefield\u2019s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal development followed by severe mental regressions. But an investigation by a British journalist found financial and scientific conflicts that Dr. Wakefield did not reveal in his paper. For instance, part of the costs of Dr. Wakefield\u2019s research were paid by lawyers for parents seeking to sue vaccine makers for damages. Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997 a measles vaccine that would succeed if the combined vaccine were withdrawn or discredited.\nA prominent British medical journal retracted a 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Britain after the paper\u2019s lead author suggested that vaccines could cause autism.\nThe retraction by The Lancet is part of a reassessment that has lasted for years of the scientific methods and financial conflicts of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research showed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may be unsafe.\nTom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the retraction of Dr. Wakefield\u2019s study \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\u201cIt builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world\u2019s leading scientists that concludes there is no link between M.M.R. vaccine and autism,\u201d Mr. Skinner wrote.\nA British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for the suffering of children involved in his research.\nDr. Wakefield\u2019s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal development followed by severe mental regressions.

Rather, science is made and shaped as authors consider the declared areas of interest, impact factors, and instructions for authors of candidate journals for their work and as the papers they submit clear the successive hurdles of eligibility screening, selection of peer reviewers, responding to reviewers\u2019 comments, statistical approval, technical editing, and distribution of press releases. A graph showing first a precipitous fall in immunisation rates in the United Kingdom and then a corresponding rise in the incidence of measles was later reproduced in the broadsheets (and in at least one GCSE biology syllabus) as an iconic symbol of bad science.\nAn academic journal is not a collection of blank pages on to which authors inscribe important scientific facts as they discover them.

Despite the small sample size (n=12), the uncontrolled design, and the speculative nature of the conclusions, the paper received wide publicity, and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination.\nAlmost immediately afterward, epidemiological studies were conducted and published, refuting the posited link between MMR vaccination and autism. The logic that the MMR vaccine may trigger autism was also questioned because a temporal link between the two is almost predestined: both events, by design (MMR vaccine) or definition (autism), occur in early childhood.\nThe next episode in the saga was a short retraction of the interpretation of the original data by 10 of the 12 co-authors of the paper. According to the retraction, \u201cno causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient\u201d. This was accompanied by an admission by the Lancet that Wakefield et al. had failed to disclose financial interests (e.g., Wakefield had been funded by lawyers who had been engaged by parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies). However, the Lancet exonerated Wakefield and his colleagues from charges of ethical violations and scientific misconduct.\nThe Lancet completely retracted the Wakefield et al. paper in February 2010, admitting that several elements in the paper were incorrect, contrary to the findings of the earlier investigation. Wakefield et al. were held guilty of ethical violations (they had conducted invasive investigations on the children without obtaining the necessary ethical clearances) and scientific misrepresentation (they reported that their sampling was consecutive when, in fact, it was selective). This retraction was published as a small, anonymous paragraph in the journal, on behalf of the editors.\nThe final episode in the saga is the revelation that Wakefield et al. were guilty of deliberate fraud (they picked and chose data that suited their case; they falsified facts). The British Medical Journal has published a series of articles on the exposure of the fraud, which appears to have taken place for financial gain. It is a matter of concern that the expos\u00e9 was a result of journalistic investigation, rather than academic vigilance followed by the institution of corrective measures. Readers may be interested to learn that the journalist on the Wakefield case, Brian Deer, had earlier reported on the false implication of thiomersal (in vaccines) in the etiology of autism. However, Deer had not played an investigative role in that report.\nIn 1998, Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues published a case series in the Lancet, which suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may predispose to behavioral regression and pervasive developmental disorder in children.

However, Deer had not played an investigative role in that report.\nSo while it was true autism was listed among the reported adverse events in the Tripedia/DTaP vaccine\u2019s insert, that same insert explained that all adverse events were listed, regardless of evidence of causation. Furthermore, the insert was current as of 2005, and was therefore hardly a novel finding in 2016. Five years after the Tripedia insert was printed, The Lancet formally retracted the 1998 paper to which fears about vaccines and autism were largely attributed, but by that point, the advancement of that idea had already left a palpable mark on public health in both the United States and in the UK.\nHowever, as FDA adverse events reporting standards dictate, all adverse reports recorded in association with drugs are included in such documents, no matter how likely (or unlikely) it was that the drug had caused them.

More important, though, is the awareness that drawing valid scientific conclusions from experimentation involves conducting multiple trials under carefully controlled conditions, something not in evidence here. The extraneous factors that could have produced the exhibited results (i.e., one live plant and one dead plant) exhibited above are legion. For example:\nRather than simply speculate, though, we performed the same experiment in a more controlled manner. We started out with three each of three different types of plants: one member of each set was given water that had been boiled on a gas stove, water that had been boiled in a microwave oven, or water that had not been boiled at all. All the water used in the experiment came from the same source, the same vessel was used for boiling water both on the stove and in the microwave, and all three types of water were stored in identical containers. The water given to all of the plants was at room temperature. The plants were kept in a carefully controlled environment that protected them from our pets and equalized (as much as possible) their exposure to environmental factors and watered in the manner described above for a period of time identical to that of the original experiment.\nAs evidenced by the photos below (taken while the plants were briefly removed from the environment in which they were tended and placed in a setting better suited to photography), at the end of that time period all three plants in each set were fairly thriving. When a non-participating observer was asked to indicate (blindly) which plant in each set he thought had fared the best, in two cases he selected plants that had been given microwave-boiled water, and in one case he selected a plant that had been given unboiled water:\n\n\n\nAs for the coda to the example quoted at the head of this page, there have been some cases in which the use of microwave-heated blood in medical procedures has been cited as causing serious problems, but not because microwave heating \u201ccorrupts the DNA.\u201d Rather, conventional microwave ovens can heat blood too quickly and/or too unevenly (resulting in hemolysis), so standard (and slower) blood warming procedures are generally preferred or mandated."}, "102": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shaving-cream-prank/", "title": "\tWill a Few Cans of Frozen Shaving Cream Fill Up a Car with Foam?", "subtitle": "\t\tMany a youngster has fantasized about pulling off pranks that may or may not be effective in practice.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Mikkelson\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["7 March 2006"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2013/09/getty_shaving_cream.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe contents of a few cans of frozen shaving cream will, when thawed, expand to fill an automobile.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOne of the many common household items that provided hours of entertainment during my childhoold after my siblings and I co-opted it as a low-tech \u201ctoy\u201d was shaving cream \u2014 or, more specifically, aerosol cans of shaving cream.  It was amazing to us kids how much foamy lather we could produce (and how much of a mess we could make) with just a little squirt or two of the stuff, and of course we fantasized about what quantity of foam would be produced by a whole can of the stuff \u2014 enough to fill the bathroom, maybe?  We never did quite answer that question definitively, as our abortive experimental attempts along these lines (performed in a straightforward manner, by holding down the button and trying to empty the can through the nozzle) resulted not in a foam-filled bathroom, but in a few young behinds being paddled red.\nThis childhood fantasy lives on, however, in the form of a belief that freezing a few cans of shaving cream (either quickly by immersing them in a bath of liquid nitrogen, or more slowly by placing them in a conventional freezer) and then carefully cutting them open will produce compact, easily transportable lumps of shaving cream material \u2014 lumps that, when allowed to thaw, will expand into a foamy cascade of tremendous volume.   This concept allows the imagining of a set-up for the perfect prank: freeze a couple of cans of shaving cream, hide the resulting frozen blobs in your victim\u2019s car, and make your getaway.  Some time afterwards (from hours to days later, depending on the temperature), while you\u2019re far away, the blobs will thaw out and expand into a messy, automobile-filling mass of shaving lather:\n\nI heard that if you freeze two cans of shaving cream (conventional freezer, or liquid nitrogen), then cut the cans open so you can take the frozen solid shaving cream out, and place them in a car, when they thaw out the entire car will be filled with shaving cream.\n\n\nI heard that if you freeze two cans of shaving cream (conventional freezer, or liquid nitrogen), then cut the cans open so you can take the frozen solid shaving cream out, and place them in a car, when they thaw out the entire car will be filled with shaving cream.\n\nUnfortunately, the reality doesn\u2019t quite live up to the fantasy, for a few basic reasons:\n\n\nAs graphic illustrations of these points, we call attention to the work of the folks at cockeyed.com, whose \u201cHow Much Is Inside\u201d exploits have included emptying an entire can of shaving cream and finding that the results were not as voluminous as expected (their truer representation of how much comes out of a can be viewed here), as well as performing the above-referenced experiment of freezing an 11-oz. can of shaving cream, extracting its contents, and allowing the frozen block of cream to thaw.  \nIn the latter case, although the thawed block increased in volume by a fairly large proportion (about 850%), it still only produced a rather disappointing 12 cups of foam overall \u2014 enough to make a fine mess (if spread about), but nearly not enough to fill the interior of a typical automobile. \nIf you really want to fill up a car with shaving cream, you\u2019d best be prepared to invest in at least a few dozen cans of the stuff."}, "103": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hurricane-open-windows/", "title": "\tShould You Open Windows During a Hurricane?", "subtitle": "\t\tStorm lore holds that opening a window slightly during a hurricane will equalize the inner pressure of a house with the outside lower pressure accompanying the hurricane.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnopes Staff\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["30 August 2005"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/GettyImages-931363710-e1567206215363.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tLeaving a window open slightly during a hurricane will help equalize pressure and prevent damage.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nThe helplessness many homeowners feel during the approach of a destructive storm contributes to the belief of a number of hurricane falsities. While people can get themselves and their loved ones out of the way of a hurricane about to make landfall, they cannot move their homes and so have to abandon them to the ravages of nature.\nHomeowners in hurricane areas do try to shield their property from weather-caused damage, but many of the popularly-believed defenses they resort to are ineffective, and one can contribute to far greater degrees of wreckage being visited upon their domiciles.\nThat latter tidbit of misinformation asserts that to relieve pressure from building up within the house during a hurricane and causing the building\u2019s roof to blow off, one should leave a few windows either fully open or slightly cracked. But the opposite is true: windows should be tightly shut to prevent any of the wind from entering the home. What does enter will seek to exit, in the process blowing out a roof or ceiling, collapsing a gable end or a garage door. Wherever the home\u2019s weak point is, such rogue winds will find it and assault it.\nThe notion of keeping some windows slightly cracked open during hurricanes crossed over from what was at one time touted as an effective defense against tornadoes but which has since been discredited. In the wake of devastating twisters, it would sometimes appear that a few houses had exploded; from this evidence, scientists theorized air pressure outside had to have been far lower than it was inside, with this disparity causing the blowout. It was therefore suggested people leave their windows open just a bit to equalize pressure.\nHowever, further research showed those blasted apart houses were the result of wind blowing into open or broken windows, so the advice, rather than preventing this particular form of destruction, would actually work to cause it. Those gusts that entered homes pushed up on the roofs at the same time wind was blowing over them, which made the roofs act like airplane wings and generate lifting force. Once roofs lift off, the walls of homes can fall outward, making it look like the buildings exploded.\nOther widely relied upon modes of protecting one\u2019s home from the ravages of a hurricane are also ineffective:\nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom; homeowners do have some recourse against the winds. They can install hurricane shutters on their windows or use specially developed new screen and fabric products on them. The mesh and fabric range from about $7 to about $25 a square foot.\nPlywood, while better than nothing, is not the home saver many believe it to be. It can help to guard windows from some of the flying debris loosed by a storm\u2019s fury. However, against the winds themselves it is not all that effective, even when properly installed (fitted perfectly to each window and screwed at 18-inch intervals into the building itself rather than merely into its siding). Plywood is a bulwark of last resort rather than a poor man\u2019s equivalent of professionally-installed hurricane shutters; one is not comparable to the other. Keep in mind that as Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spokeswoman Sylvia E. Farrington noted, even a minimal hurricane can drill a 2-by-4 through a concrete wall. Now imagine how well plywood window coverings would fare.\nOne last caution: If you stay in your home during a hurricane and the power goes out, do not light candles or gas or oil lanterns because of the potential for gas leaks from storm-damaged lines. Instead, use only flashlights or battery-powered lanterns during and after a storm until power is safely restored and all gas lines are checked.\n\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040704115442/http://www.flash.org/activity.cfm?currentPeril=1&amp;activityID=179\" target=\"flash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Animated How-To on Protecting Windows and Doors from Hurricanes</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040816004457/http://www.flash.org/activity.cfm?currentPeril=1&amp;activityID=107\" target=\"flash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Doors and Windows \u2014 Protecting</a>\n"}, "104": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coriolis-effect/", "title": "\tDoes the Coriolis Effect Determine Which Direction Water Goes Down a Drain?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe notion that the Coriolis force determines which direction water spirals down drains is one of the most prominent scientific myths.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSnopes Staff\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["28 April 2003"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2009/06/coriolis.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe Coriolis force determines which direction water spirals down drains and toilets in different hemispheres.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nBecause the Earth is a globe spinning on an invisible axis, a point at its equator will make a circuit of 25,000 miles in the space of a day, but any point not on the equator will make a shorter round trip; the closer that point is to either of the poles, the shorter its trip will be. Put another way, a pencil at the equator travels 1,030 miles an hour, whereas another at Sarasota, Florida, moves at 930 miles per hour, and one at the North pole doesn\u2019t move at all.\nThis apparent difference in speed results in the Coriolis force, an effect that imparts a twist to largish events happening away from the equator. Best known is its effect on air masses: as they move away from the equator, their speed (which matches that of where they started from) appears to be faster than that of the surface over which they are traveling.  Coriolis deflection sets cyclonic systems turning counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.  Likewise, a cannonball fired due north will seemingly veer a teeny bit to the east, and one fired to the south will apparently deflect ever so slightly to the west, deviations a skilled gunner would know to adjust for.\nThe twisting effect of the Coriolis force is real, and it does influence certain large things such as the movement of air masses.  It is also commonly claimed to affect the way water spirals down drains in different parts of the world:\n\nWater in a pan, sink, or toilet rotates counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis Effect, which is caused by the rotation of the Earth.\n\n\nWater in a pan, sink, or toilet rotates counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis Effect, which is caused by the rotation of the Earth.\n\nHowever, the Coriolis effect is so small that it plays no role in determining the direction in which water rotates as it exits from a draining sink or toilet. The Coriolis effect produces a measurable influence over huge distances and long periods of time, neither of which applies to the typical terrestrial bathroom. \nToilets and sinks drain in the directions they do because of the way water is directed into them or pulled from them. If water enters in a swirling motion (as it does when a toilet is flushed, for example), the water will exit in that same swirling pattern. As well, most basins have irregular surfaces and are not perfectly level, factors that influence the direction in which water spirals down their drains. The configuration of taps and drains is responsible for the direction of spin given to water draining from sinks and bathtubs to a degree that overwhelms the slight influence of the Coriolis force.\nThe belief that the Coriolis force influences the direction in which water drains from plumbing fixtures is widespread and has been repeated as fact in a number of venues, including popular television shows (such as world traveler Michael Palin\u2019s Pole to Pole series) and even in textbooks.  It\u2019s also been promulgated by any number of hucksters who set up rigged demonstrations along the equator for the amusement of gullible tourists:\n(The trick behind this demonstration is explained here.)\nAn introductory meteorology textbook includes (and addresses) this misbelief as one of the subjects students commonly ask about:\n\nQ: I\u2019ve been told that water goes down a sink in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere and in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere. Is that true?\nA:  No! The origin of this myth comes from applying a scientific principle to a situation where it does not fit. The Coriolis deflection causes cyclonic systems to rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. It was inevitable that someone would suggest (without checking) that a sink should drain in a similar manner.  \nHowever, a cyclone is more than 1000 kilometers in diameter and may exist for several days. By contrast, a typical sink is less than a meter in diameter and drains in a matter of seconds. On this scale, the Coriolis force is miniscule. Therefore, the shape of the  sink and how level it is has more to do with the direction of water flow than the Coriolis force.\n\n\nQ: I\u2019ve been told that water goes down a sink in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere and in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere.

Though these bugs neither bite nor sting, at certain times of the year their sheer numbers transform these innocuous insects into airborne hordes seemingly determined to devil anyone fool enough to take to the road.\nThe adults splatter on windshields, lights, grills, and radiators of motor vehicles, and their dried remains can be difficult to remove. Suicidal pairs of love bugs have been known to cause overheating of motors when large numbers of them are drawn into the cooling systems of liquid-cooled engines. Unlike other bugs, something particular to them adversely affects the paint jobs on cars, pitting and etching the paint if their mortal remains are left on vehicles for more than 48 hours.\nEvery May and September these sex-crazed critters become an annoyance bordering on intolerable as the air teems with mating pairs.

Some less specific versions of the Great Wall claim maintain it is the only man-made object that can be seen from \u201cspace,\u201d but although the term \u201cspace\u201d is rather non-specific, it is not difficult to show the Great Wall claim to be false for any reasonable definition of the term.\nIf we take \u201cspace\u201d to mean a low Earth orbit such as the one traveled by the Space Shuttle (roughly 160 to 350 miles above Earth), the Great Wall claim fails twice. First of all, it\u2019s not the only object visible from that distance: NASA\u2019s Earth from Space photographic archive (particularly the Human Interactions section) shows that pictures taken from low orbit reveal human-built structures such as highways, airports, bridges, dams, and components of the Kennedy Space Center. Secondly, even though other objects are visible at this distance, according to Shuttle astronaut Jay Apt, the Great Wall is barely discernable, if not invisible:\nWe look for the Great Wall of China. Although we can see things as small as airport runways, the Great Wall seems to be made largely of materials that have the same color as the surrounding soil. Despite persistent stories that it can be seen from the moon, the Great Wall is almost invisible from only 180 miles up!\nWe look for the Great Wall of China.

Despite persistent stories that it can be seen from the moon, the Great Wall is almost invisible from only 180 miles up!\nAn object that can barely be seen from a height of 180 miles up is obviously not going to be visible from the moon (roughly 237,000 miles away), as confirmed by Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean:\nThe only thing you can see from the moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white (clouds), some blue (ocean), patches of yellow (deserts), and every once in a while some green vegetation. No man-made object is visible on this scale. In fact, when first leaving earth\u2019s orbit and only a few thousand miles away, no man-made object is visible at that point either.\u201d\nThe only thing you can see from the moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white (clouds), some blue (ocean), patches of yellow (deserts), and every once in a while some green vegetation.

The exact source is unknown, but an important citing comes from Richard Halliburton\u2019s Second Book of Marvels, the Orient, published in 1938, which states that \u201cAstronomers say that the Great Wall is the only man-made thing on our planet visible to the human eye from the moon.\u201d Halliburton was an adventurer-lecturer whose travel writings were extremely popular and sold quite well during the first half of the twentieth century (and who wasn\u2019t above spinning tall tales in order to enthrall an audience), and if he himself wasn\u2019t the originator of this factoid, he undoubtedly helped it to spread widely.\nAn even earlier source, Henry Norman\u2019s 1904 The People and Politics of the Far East states: \u201cBesides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the moon.\u201d\nWhatever its source, since the Great Wall claim antedates man\u2019s launching of satellites (and thereby the possibility of photography from space) by decades, it was not the outgrowth of a misinterpreted photograph taken by satellite or a manned space mission. The Great Wall of China extends for some 1,500 miles (although it is actually a series of walls rather than one contiguous wall), and the claim that it is visible from the moon was probably an attempt to find a concise way of conveying the grand scale of the wall to people who had never seen it (outside of black-and-white photographs that could only reproduce small portions of the wall) and of asserting the triumph of man\u2019s mastery of the vastness of nature (i.e., even if we couldn\u2019t travel into space ourselves, we\u2019d already constructed a man-made object of such large scale that it would surely be visible all the way from the moon)."}, "107": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swallow-spiders/", "title": "\tDo People Swallow Eight Spiders Per Year?", "subtitle": "\t\tOne of the most widely-circulated bits of misinformation to be found on the internet.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Mikkelson\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["23 April 2001"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2014/04/GettyImages-683844819-e1556745441674.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe average person swallows eight spiders per year.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIt\u2019s hard enough to avoid those horrible wriggly things while we\u2019re awake, and now we have to worry that they\u2019re crawling into our mouths while we sleep?

This \u201cstatistic\u201d average the average person swallowing eight spiders per year was not only made up out of whole cloth, it was invented as an example of the absurd things people will believe simply because they come across them on the Internet.\nAs noted in Scientific American, this claim is highly implausible from a biological standpoint:\nThe myth flies in the face of both spider and human biology, which makes it highly unlikely that a spider would ever end up in your mouth.\nThree or four spider species live in most North American homes, and they all tend to be found either tending their webs or hunting in nonhuman-infested areas.

In a 1993 PC Professional article, columnist Lisa Holst wrote about the ubiquitous lists of \u201cfacts\u201d that were circulating via e-mail and how readily they were accepted as truthful by gullible recipients. To demonstrate her point, Holst offered her own made-up list of equally ridiculous \u201cfacts,\u201d among which was the statistic cited above about the average person\u2019s swallowing eight spiders per year, which she took from a collection of common misbeliefs printed in a 1954 book on insect folklore.

Too terrified to even THINK of it. Never saw red stains in the water, either.\nAs \u201cAlan\u201d at the Aqua Clear web site says, \u201cThere is no chemical that can function as an indicator for urine in a pool.\u201d Others in the industry concur: this belief is all chimera and no substance.\nThose in the pool supply business are routinely confronted with requests for the \u201curine-indicator dye\u201d (as the mythical substance has come to be known). The belief in such a chemical spans many countries, as does the juvenile certainty particular pools are spiked with it.\nExperts on such matters say although a reliable urine-detecting dye could be produced, the trick would be getting it to react only to urine and to not trigger in the presence of similar organic compounds likely present in swimming pools. It\u2019s not a compound anyone appears to be working on either, and with good reason: who\u2019d want it? Kids are kids, and their expected reaction to the news that pissing in the pool would produce bright purple or red trails would be to jump right in with the intent of putting that theory to the test. Especially in a public pool where one\u2019s indiscretions can be blamed on the fellow swimming by, what kid wouldn\u2019t avail himself of the naughty pleasure of invoking billowing clouds of dye?\nOr, as one old-time Boston-area poolman put it, \u201cIf such chemicals did exist, every municipal pool in Boston would be bright purple.\u201d (A heartening thought, that. One could drown Barney, and the body wouldn\u2019t be found for days.)\nChalk this belief up as what it is: yet another sneaky parent trick meant to keep kids in check. A similar baseless rumor about naughty perpetrators being caught red-handed (so to speak) has to do with school fire alarms. A number of kids have heard these mechanisms are booby-trapped with a packet of red dye that will spray upon whoever pulls the lever, marking him as the one who did the deed. (Yes, dyes are sometimes used with fire alarms to help catch pranksters who take perverse delight in setting off false alarms, but those dyes have come into widespread use only fairly recently, and they are most commonly used as booby-traps set by investigators who have some idea who the perpetrator is or where he will strike next, not as a permanent feature of the alarms. Most kids who were told that all of their schools\u2019 fire alarms were set to mark anyone who triggered them with a special dye were being hoaxed with a bit of deterrent fiction.)\nSightings: \u00a0 Barbara Leaming\u2019s 1985 Orson Welles \u2014 A Biography claims Welles and his pal Charlie MacArthur pulled this \u201curine-indicator dye\u201d prank on their friends around 1937 and were rewarded with raspberry-colored clouds billowing in the water around the guilty swimmers. In an episode of Nickelodeon\u2019s The Adventures of Pete & Pete (\u201cSplashdown\u201d), a substance called \u201cWee-Wee See\u201d is used to catch a pool-peeing perpetrator.

The first is from the Book of Joshua and describes Joshua\u2019s defense of Gibeon from the five kings of the Amorites. In order to enable Joshua to finish off his enemies before they had a chance to flee under cover of darkness, God provided additional daylight by causing the sun to stand still in the sky for nearly a day:\n10:12 \u00a0 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\n10:13 \u00a0 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day\n10:12 \u00a0 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.\n10:13 \u00a0 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day\nThe second passage, from 2 Kings, describes Hezekiah\u2019s request that God move the sun ten degrees backwards as confirmation of his promise that Hezekiah would be delivered into Heaven:\n20:8 \u00a0 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?\n20:9 \u00a0 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?\n20:10 \u00a0 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.\n20:11 \u00a0 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\n20:8 \u00a0 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day?\n20:9 \u00a0 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?\n20:10 \u00a0 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees.\n20:11 \u00a0 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\nOne of the first issues we have to consider is that the Bible is thousands of years old, and the accounts it contains have come to us through many oral tellings, re-copyings, printings, and translations. We have to be very careful about presenting a specific interpretation of a single English word or phrase from one particular version of the Bible as being \u201cwhat the Bible actually says.\u201d Therefore, the first difficulty this legend presents is that nowhere in the Bible (in the Book of Joshua or elsewhere) is it stated that God made the sun stand still for exactly 23 hours and 20 minutes. Various translations word Joshua 10:13 differently, but most agree that the sun stood still for something less than a day: \u201cabout a whole day\u201d or \u201cnearly a day.\u201d We\u2019re told nothing more specific \u2014 \u201cabout a whole day\u201d could also mean 22 hours and 48 minutes or 23 hours and 2 minutes; we have no way of telling. (The primary means of reckoning the passage of time in Joshua\u2019s era was by observing the apparent movement of celestial bodies through the sky relative to the observer. It\u2019s not likely any contemporary of Joshua\u2019s could have recorded the length of time the sun stood still with this degree of precision under the best of circumstances, and certainly not when the sun and moon were both fixed in the sky, and the sun\u2019s light prevented the sighting of any other stars.) As it turns out, the \u201c23 hours and 20 minutes\u201d figure was almost certainly an amount of time chosen by the legend\u2019s originator for extra-scriptual reasons we\u2019ll explain later.\nThe next difficulty is the interpretation presented in this legend of the statement in 2 Kings 20 about God\u2019s moving \u201cthe shadow\u201d backwards \u201cten degrees\u201d as meaning that the sun\u2019s shadow was moved backwards through ten angular degrees of measurement on a dial (presumably a sundial). Since a dial is a circle, and a circle contains 360 degrees, moving the sun\u2019s shadow backwards ten degrees would correspond to resetting time by one thirty-sixth of day. One thirty-sixth of a twenty-four hour day is two-thirds of an hour, or forty minutes. Voil\u00e0! The problem is, 2 Kings 20 doesn\u2019t quite say this \u2014 the word \u201cdegree\u201d is an artifact of certain English translations. How this passage is presented in other translations is more general: that the sun\u2019s shadow moved backwards ten steps (or ten units or ten intervals or ten markings) on the \u201cdial of Ahaz.\u201d Since we have no idea exactly what the \u201cdial of Ahaz\u201d was, nor how much time was represented by one of its units, we cannot make any real estimate as to how far the sun actually moved. (If the dial of Ahaz had forty evenly-spaced markings on it, for example, ten of those units would represent one-fourth of a day, or six hours.)\nWe can only speculate, but it seems likely that once the originator of this legend decided upon an interpretation of 2 Kings 20 that created a \u201clost\u201d 40 minutes of time, he also decided that the \u201cabout a whole day\u201d described in Joshua 10 was a period of exactly 23 hours and 20 minutes so that the two amounts combined would equal exactly one day (even though the length day is actually about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Why? Perhaps because God is associated with balance and perfection, and any natural process that appears ordered is often attributed to divine handiwork: if scientists discovered a \u201cmissing\u201d 23 hours and 18 minutes, that could be taken as some random fluke of the cosmos, but if the \u201cmissing\u201d period were exactly one day, that would be evidence of a directed celestial intervention by a higher power.\nRegardless of the amount of time involved, the discovery of a \u201cmissing\u201d period of time remains implausible. If the sun had indeed stood still for a day a few millennia ago, we would have no way of determining that fact through astronomic observations today. We have no frame of reference, no cosmic calendar or master clock to check against to see if we\u2019re overdrawn at the Bank of Time. The concept described here would be like giving someone a non-functioning clock and asking him to determine how much time had elapsed since the clock had stopped running. One could note the positions of the hands on the dial and make a reasonable guess about what the time of day was when the clock stopped running, but without knowing whether that time was A.M. or P.M., and without knowing the calendar date on which stoppage occurred, one could not possibly make any reasonable estimate about how long ago the clock stopped.\nEven the putative reasons offered for the scientists\u2019 performing the calculations described in this legend make little sense. We need not know about any \u201cmissing time\u201d in the past in order to be able to launch spacecraft today. Even if the sun really did once stand still for a day, that would have absolutely no effect on where the sun, the moon, or the other planets are going to be one hundred or one thousand years from now. If we put a new battery in our stopped clock, all we have to do to get it back on track is to set it to the correct time; we don\u2019t need to determine how much time the clock \u201clost\u201d while it wasn\u2019t running to be assured that it will display the correct time in the future.\nThe appeal of this legend isn\u2019t difficult to see: the tale confirms not only the existence of God, but also the literal truth of the Bible. Moreover, it pits the scientists versus the believers, with the believers emerging victorious and the (presumed godless) scientists left ground into dust by the very science they\u2019d so long and so loudly upheld. David (in the form of the pure-hearted believer) takes on the Goliath of Science who continally bleats for independently verifiable proof of the Almighty, and for once the faithful are able to deliver up on a silver platter what\u2019s been asked for.\nTo those who\u2019ve given over their hearts to God and the Holy Word, this is a deeply satisfying legend. Faith is, after all, the firm belief in something which cannot necessarily be proved, a quality that can leave believers (especially those who find themselves in the midst of non-believers) feeling unsatisfied. As steadfast as their certainty is, they cannot prove the rightness of the path they tread to those who jeer at their convictions. And this is a heavy burden to shoulder. A legend such as the \u201cmissing day explained\u201d tale speaks straight to the hearts of those who yearn for a bit of vindication in this life. Being right isn\u2019t always enough: sometimes what one most longs for is sweet recognition from others.\nThat recognition, and that satisfaction, is what this legend provides. Intoxicatingly heady stuff, that. No wonder this tale has survived from generation to generation and withstood the ravages of countless debunkings. Nonetheless, its factual details are wrong, the scientific processes it describes are dubious, and its premise of a \u201cmissing day\u201d depends upon some very selective and questionable intepretations of scripture.\nAuthenticity matters little, though: our willingness to accept legends depends far more upon their expression of concepts we want to believe than upon their plausibility. If the sun once really did stand still for a day, the best evidence we\u2019d have for proving it would be the accounts of people who saw it happen. That is what the Bible is said to offer. Some people accept that as sufficient proof, and others don\u2019t."}, "110": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/egg-balancing-on-the-equinox/", "title": "\tEgg Balancing on the Equinox", "subtitle": "\t\tIt is not true that a special property of the equinox allows eggs (or brooms) to be balanced on their ends that day.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDavid Mikkelson\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["17 March 1999"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/GettyImages-935514082-e1561065786770.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA special property of the equinox allows eggs (or brooms) to be balanced on their ends that day.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nEvery year on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes (on or about March 20 and September 22), the two days per year in which the length of day and night are the same, we hear about a magical property of these days that allows eggs to be balanced on end. Rarely does a year go by in which a local TV news station doesn\u2019t send a reporter out to a neighborhood park to capture images of people delightedly placing eggs on the ground and watching in amazement as the eggs stand on end. Rarely do we see any new stories reporting that this same feat can be achieved every other day of the year as well.\nThe equinoxes, which mark the beginning of spring and autumn, have long held a special importance in human society. Particularly the vernal equinox, which marks the first day of spring and the end of winter, the beginning of the season in which daylight again outlasts darkness and life springs anew. Flowers blossom, trees shoot out new leaves and branches, and animals give birth (or their eggs hatch). These tangible signs of the world\u2019s rebirth were of paramount importance to agricultural societies, and they naturally developed elaborate fertility rites to celebrate the occasion.\nThus eggs \u2014 one of the most ubiquitous symbols of fertility and birth \u2014 have long been associated with the beginning of spring, and hence with the equinox. Many, many superstitions involving the breaking, balancing, burying, decorating, reading (for purposes of divination) and hiding of eggs have come to be part of the annual spring celebration. (The linking of egg-balancing with spring celebrations is demonstrated by the fact that the practice is associated primarily with the vernal equinox and far less commonly with the autumnal equinox.)\n\nThe Chinese are often cited as having originated the practice of standing eggs on end during the equinox. Just as the equinox symbolically restores balance to the world by signalling its rebirth after a season of darkness, the equinox literally balances the day by dividing it into equal portions of darkness and light. If the symbol of fertility, eggs, could be balanced on end during a day equally divided between day and night, this was a sign that all nature was in harmony.\nNonetheless, the vernal equinox brings no special egg-balancing properties with it. Standing an egg on its end is something just about anyone can do any day of the year; the feat simply takes the right egg and a little trial and practice. Since the vast majority of people never see or try balancing eggs on their ends on any day other than the equinox, though, many of them come away from the experience believing that something special must have occurred on that particular day. As the Associated Press reported in 1987, however, scientific trial shows otherwise:\nEgg balancing, most popular at the spring equinox in March but said to be possible in both seasons, has attracted publicity in recent years \u2014 with scientists skeptical and ritual-makers adamant.\nFinally a scientist has published research into the matter and concluded that yes indeed, he could balance an egg \u2014 actually several eggs \u2014 at the moment of the equinox.\nBut, on the other side of the coin, he was also able to do so at lots of other times.\n\u201cThe upshot is that, as far as I can tell, there isn\u2019t too much relationship between astronomical phenomena and balancing eggs. It is basically a function of the shape of the egg and the surface,\u201d said astronomer Frank D. Ghigo.\nGhigo, of the University of Minnesota, decided to study egg balancing after receiving questions about it from members of the public who had read about the annual spring egg balancing festival in New York City.\nGhigo used four samples of a dozen eggs each, which he attempted to balance on their large ends on a Formica tabletop each day between Feb. 27 and April 3, 1984. The spring equinox occurred on March 20, 1984.\nGhigo found the eggs have many bumps and irregularities and with patience some of them could be made to balance virtually every day \u2014 while some eggs would simply never balance, on the equinox or otherwise.\nHe concluded that \u201cthe mood and persistence of the balancer has a major effect on the balancing rate. If one is impatient or nervous, the rate is low.\u201d\nOver time, Ghigo found, the percentage of eggs he could balance improved, concluding \u201cI think I got better, just through practice.\u201d\nEgg balancing, most popular at the spring equinox in March but said to be possible in both seasons, has attracted publicity in recent years \u2014 with scientists skeptical and ritual-makers adamant.\nFinally a scientist has published research into the matter and concluded that yes indeed, he could balance an egg \u2014 actually several eggs \u2014 at the moment of the equinox.\nBut, on the other side of the coin, he was also able to do so at lots of other times.\n\u201cThe upshot is that, as far as I can tell, there isn\u2019t too much relationship between astronomical phenomena and balancing eggs.

Just like eggs, though, many brooms can be stood on their ends any old day of the year. The feat works best with newer brooms which have uniform, evenly cut bristles, with the angle of the bristle cut offsetting the lean angle of the broom:\n\nThis legend also popped up as a subject discussed by characters in an episode of the political drama The West Wing (\u201cEvidence of Things Not Seen,\u201d originally aired 23 April 2003):"}}
