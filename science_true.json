Several revolutions renders the mixture completely clear and \u201cmixed.\u201d If one now reverses the direction of rotation, the colored fluid lines reappear by \u201cunmixing\u201d after the same number of rotations in the opposite sense,\u201d read a presentation posted by the Harvard Natural Sciences Lecture Demonstration.\u00a0\nBecause the slow, steady mixing does not create turbulence, the colors are able to be \u201cunmixed\u201d due to a concept known as laminar flow. In contrast to turbulent flow, where a fluid undergoes irregular mixing, laminar flow allows a liquid to travel smoothly.\nTo visualize the concept, think of a river where the uppermost layer of the water bounces off obstacles like rocks or eddies, causing it to mix and fold unto itself, thus undergoing what is known as turbulent mixing. Below that uppermost layer is the laminar flow, or the part of the water that follows a straight path and does not hit obstacles and become mixed.\u00a0\n\u201cDiffusion processes are, of course, much slower than the time scale of the demonstration. As one cylinder is rotated, the other one can simply think of layers of fluid being displaced without involving turbulence, the boundary layer next to the inner rotating cylinder being displaced the most and the layer adjacent to the outside cylinder the least. Counter rotation slips these layers back into place,\u201d wrote Harvard.\u00a0\nSources\n\u201cHttps://Twitter.Com/Amazing_physics/Status/1453587546278092802.\u201d Twitter, https://twitter.com/amazing_physics/status/1453587546278092802.

In the last month, NASA says that 14 known asteroids passed closer to Earth than the moon \u2014 a number that reaches 127 when counting back 365 days.\nThat\u2019s where NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office comes in. This branch is responsible for finding, tracking, and characterizing near-Earth asteroids and objects, and this marks its first attempt at what is called the kinetic impactor technique, which sends a spacecraft like DART to the path of an asteroid to change its motion.\n\u201cDART is our first full-scale attempt to demonstrate that we can change the motion of an asteroid in space, potentially as a way of defending Earth against the hazard of asteroid impacts,\u201d said Tom Statler, a DART scientist, in a podcast interview.\nAsteroids orbit the sun like our home planet does, and when they are in their solar orbit, they do not come near Earth\u2019s orbit or pose a threat. Asteroids that are potentially hazardous are those whose orbits intersect with Earth\u2019s. To find those potential threats, telescopes around the world consistently scan the skies and collect data ultimately compiled by the International Astronomical Union\u2019s (IAU) Minor Planet Center. IAU then determines whether a detected moving object is an asteroid, calibrates its orbit, and figures whether it has the potential to make contact with Earth.\n\nThe #DARTmission is @NASA\u2019s first #PlanetaryDefense test mission and will impact an asteroid to demonstrate a technique that could be used in the future to protect Earth from a potential impact. #CountdownToLaunch on November 24!

And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do with DART. We\u2019re going to demonstrate one technology to cause that deflection that, someday, if we need to, we might use this technology to prevent an asteroid from hitting the Earth,\u201d explained Statler.\nThe half-ton spacecraft will spend the better part of a year transiting to the binary asteroid system, Didymos, which is made up of two asteroids that orbit around each other. Just as the sun holds Earth in its orbit, the half-mile wide asteroid Didymos holds its football stadium-sized moon Dimorphos in orbit. DART is expected to run into the side of this small moon at a high velocity of 4 miles per second to change the motion of the binary asteroid, eventually slowing down and tightening up its orbit around the larger asteroid.\n\u201cOrbits are like donkeys, you pull them one way and they go the other way. So that\u2019s an aspect of this. You hit the thing to slow it down and it ends up going around faster,\u201d explained Statler.\nCurrently, no known asteroid has a chance of impacting Earth in a century, according to Statler, but there could be some we haven\u2019t yet discovered, and science is finding new ones all the time. And because scientists have been observing Didymos for decades, this \u201cnatural laboratory\u201d will help researchers to determine whether systems like DART can move an asteroid and if so, by how much.\n\u201cThe images DRACO returns of the target asteroid Dimorphos, including the last-second glimpse of its own impact site on the asteroid, will be crucial toward analyzing the results of the DART test and understanding how the asteroid was affected,\u201d wrote NASA in a news statement.\nDART is scheduled to launch at 10:20 p.m. PST on Nov. 23 aboard a SpaceX Falcon rocket and ill be live-streamed from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The spacecraft will intercept Didymos\u2019 moonlet in late September 2022 when Didymos is within 6.8 million miles of Earth. And yes, it will be visible to ground-based telescopes.\nSources\nDART. https://dart.jhuapl.edu/.

Unseeable by the human eyes, infrared light is used to view the thermal activity, or heat, of objects to paint a clearer picture of worlds beyond our own.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the center of the image, partially obscured by a dark cloak of dust, a newborn star shoots twin jets of hot gas out into space as a sort of birth announcement to the universe,\u201d said NASA in an article dedicated to the Hubble Telescope\u2019s 30th anniversary.\u00a0\u00a0\nHubble is equipped with multiple cameras and measuring devices that capture images \u2014 but they are all done so in false color, or black and white. To get the vibrant colors seen in photographs taken by the telescope, scientists assign different colors.\u00a0\n\u201cTo summarize, there are things Hubble can\u2019t see that we want to know more about, and we need an infrared telescope to learn about them. Things like: stars and planets being born in clouds of dust and gas; the very first stars and galaxies which are so far away the light they emit has been pushed into the infrared; and the chemical fingerprints of elements and molecules in the atmospheres of exoplanets,\u201d wrote NASA outreach specialist Maggie Masetti.\u00a0\nFound in the Milky Way, our home galaxy, the event photographed is described by NASA as Herbig-Haro Jet HH 24, a bright patch of nebulosity, or a large cloud of gas and dust, associated with newborn stars. These form when narrow jets of partially ionized gas ejected by stars collide with nearby nebulous material.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe photograph showed a star being born in a \u201cturbulent birthing ground\u201d known as Orion B molecular cloud complex, which is located 1,350 light-years from Earth. (A light-year is the measurement of light traveling in a single Earth year, equating one light year to 6 trillion miles.) In the Orion complex, Orion B meets with the neighboring Orion A cloud complex in the constellation of Orion. Over a few million years, thousands of stars have been born in this active dual-cloud area.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen stars form within giant clouds of cool molecular hydrogen, some of the surrounding material collapses under gravity to form a rotating, flattened disk encircling the newborn star,\u201d wrote NASA in a December 2020 blog post accompanying the image.\n\u201cAlthough planets will later congeal in the disk, at this early stage the protostar is feeding on the disk with a voracious appetite. Gas from the disk rains down onto the protostar and engorges it. Superheated material spills away and is shot outward from the star in opposite directions along an uncluttered escape route \u2014 the star\u2019s rotation axis.\u201d\nShocks along these jets heat the surrounding gas to temperatures reaching thousands of degrees Fahrenheit that then collide with surrounding nebulous matter \u201clike a stream of water plowing into a hill of sand.\u201d\u00a0\nNASA launched the school bus-sized telescope in 1990, and in the three decades since, Hubble has been orbiting the earth at a rate of 5 miles per second \u2014 the equivalent of driving a car across North America in 10 minutes. Not only has Hubble seen stars being born, but it has captured stars as they died and planets, stars, and galaxies trillions of miles away. It works by facing towards and photographing space just outside of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which otherwise blocks most of the light from space. This, NASA says, enables the telescope to digitally snap photographs and send them back to Earth using radio waves.\u00a0\nThe successor to Hubble will be the James Webb Space Telescope, the world\u2019s largest and most powerful telescope to be launched in space in December 2021.\u00a0\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough stellar excitement to tide you over until then, here are a few other out-of-this-world images captured by Hubble:\u00a0\nStellar Birth\nCarina Nebula\nPillars of Creation\nStellar Jewelry Box\nStar Eta Carinae\nSources\n\u201cBeholding the Birth and Death of Stars.\u201d HubbleSite.Org, http://hubblesite.org/home/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/beholding-the-birth-and-death-of-stars.

Additionally, the website for the records indeed lists the Purdue researchers\u2019 \u201cbarium sulphate paint\u201d as the world\u2019s whitest.\nBut that isn\u2019t the paint\u2019s only special quality.\nThe paint made news headlines months earlier in spring 2021, soon after the American Chemical Society published a report\u00a0written by Ruan\u2019s team.\nIn that publication, as well as an April news release by Purdue, the researchers explained how the white paint reflects up to 98.1% of sunlight, and simultaneously sends infrared heat away from its surface \u2014 a process that could help keep buildings cool without so much air conditioning, unlike similarly designed products. (For comparison, other paints that aim to reject heat only reflect 80%-90% of sunlight and do not contain properties to make surfaces cooler than their surroundings, according to the release.)\n\u201cIf you were to use this paint to cover a roof area of about 1,000 square feet, we estimate that you could get a cooling power of 10 kilowatts.

But there are a few caveats to note, namely that this is the second round of attention it has garnered on social media.\u00a0\nThe assisted swimmer video initially made headlines when it was first published in a 2016 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Nano Letters, a publication by the American Chemical Society. The so-called \u201cspermbot\u201d was developed by researchers at the German Institute for Integrative Nanosciences in an effort to find new approaches to addressing infertility.\nLet\u2019s be clear: The technology is a prototype that was recorded propelling immotile sperm toward an oocyte in a petri dish, or in vitro, and not in a living organism. Latin for \u201cwithin the glass,\u201d in vitro studies are performed using biological cells and molecules outside of a living organism. (In vivo, on the other hand, translates to \u201cwithin the living\u201d and refers to work within an organism.)\u00a0\nThe main cause of infertility is low sperm motility or sperm that are otherwise healthy but can\u2019t swim. Cue the spermbot, designed as an alternative to other infertility treatments like artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. The nanobot consists of a metal helix large enough to wrap around the sperm and uses a rotating magnetic field to latch on to the tail of sperm to \u201cdrive\u201d it into an egg for potential fertilization.\u00a0\nMicromotors like the spermbot are inspired by their natural counterparts and mimic natural processes with the help of human-powered assistance, like magnetic fields. But despite their promise, the precision of delivery, and biocompatibility, the compatibility of nonorganic material with living tissue, remain challenges in the human body.\u00a0\nThe hybrid micromotor uses a spermatozoon as an \u201conboard power supply\u201d and coupled with the microtube that was remote-controlled by an external magnetic field, the sperm tail still provides propulsion for \u201ccellular cargo delivery.\u201d In short, these \u201ccustomized microhelics\u201d serve as motors that can transport sperm cells that have motion deficiencies.\u00a0\n\u201cOur results indicate that metal-coated polymer microhelics are suitable for this task due to potent, controllable, and nonharmful 3D motion behavior,\u201d wrote the study authors. \u201cWe manage to capture, transport, and release single immotile live sperm cells in fluidic channels that allow mimicking physiological conditions.\u201d\u00a0\nSuccessful capture, as seen in the video, shows the tail being confined inside the inner part of the microhelix, head sticks out at the front end and is loosely bound by a ring that \u201cacts like a noose to prevent the sperm head from slipping back through the helix.\u00a0\nLimitations in the technology arose when comparing different sperm and egg cells, each of which have to be transferred from culture dishes to another platform for testing that caused delays and temperature fluctuations \u2014 both factors that can influence success rates. Still, the authors say their work serves to demonstrate a new approach to artificial reproduction in the future.\n\u201cUnfortunately, similar to many promising applications in biomedical engineering, it appears to be still a long way from artificially motorized sperm delivery to actual oocyte fertilization,\u201d wrote the researchers, adding that the success of this novel approach lies in its potential.\u00a0\nTesting in petri dishes was a \u201cpromising start\u201d that could one day lead to a treatment for male infertility, but required more research before it could be applied to humans, the researchers concluded.\u00a0\n\u201cDespite the fact that there still remain some challenges on the way to achieve successful fertilization with artificially motorized sperms, we believe that the potential of this novel approach toward assisted reproduction can be already put into perspective with the present work,\u201d wrote the study authors.\u00a0\nSnopes contacted the researchers to learn more about the current standing of the technology, and whether it may be fit for human testing but did not hear back in time for publication. We will update the article accordingly.\u00a0\nSources\nMedina-S\u00e1nchez, Mariana, et al. \u201cCellular Cargo Delivery: Toward Assisted Fertilization by Sperm-Carrying Micromotors.\u201d Nano Letters, vol. 16, no. 1, Jan. 2016, pp. 555\u201361.

The farmland in Ghent, which is about 37 miles (or 60 kilometers) from Brussels, was the home of Winter \u2014 a 5-year-old llama who spends her days grazing with about 130 of her alpaca and llama friends, according to a 2020 Golden Goose Award\u00a0entry dedicated to her contributions to science.\nBut in addition to those traits, Winter\u2019s immune system supposedly produced a special, very small antibody that, the August 2021 reports claimed, may lead to medical products that could stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, in humans\u2019 immune systems.\n\nIn short, the underlying assertion was this: Researchers had recently injected human test subjects with a formula that included remnants of cells from a llama\u2019s blood to see if, or to what extent, those nonhuman antibodies helped combat SARS-CoV-2.\nThat claim was true, though we\u2019ll provide some important context to make sense of the research.\nYears before the pandemic, Jason McLellan, an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Austin, teamed up with Ghent-based researchers at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology to study camelids\u2019 antibodies and how they react to immunizations, according to the Golden Goose Award entry. (\u201cCamelids\u201d include camels, alpacas, and llamas.) Their goal: to determine whether, and how, llama\u2019s immune systems could produce antibodies that could be used for medical therapies.\n\u201cWhile humans only make one kind of antibody, made up of heavy and light protein chains arranged in a Y-shape, camelids produce two,\u201d the entry stated. \u201cOne of these is very similar to a human antibody. The other, called a single-domain antibody, VHH, or nanobody, does not have any light-chain proteins. This makes it much smaller, which is a boon to researchers.\u201d\nIn 2016, with the support of the National Institutes of Health, the researchers narrowed in on coronaviruses. Seven such viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most of people will catch at least one in their lifetimes and experience cold-like symptoms. Meanwhile, a smaller population may suffer severe and sometimes fatal infections from coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1, which caused the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, or MERS-CoV.\nEnter Winter, who was 9 months old at the time. Researchers vaccinated her with spike proteins from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to see how her immune system would react, according to a news release\u00a0and the award entry. The NIH explained the experiment like this:\n[Spike protiens] latch onto cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the virus to fuse with the cell. Once the virus enters the host cell, it can copy itself and produce more viruses. The nanobodies that the scientists harvested from the llama bloodstream and produced in the lab bound to the spike protein and prevented the virus from entering cells.\n[Spike protiens] latch onto cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the virus to fuse with the cell. Once the virus enters the host cell, it can copy itself and produce more viruses. The nanobodies that the scientists harvested from the llama bloodstream and produced in the lab bound to the spike protein and prevented the virus from entering cells.\nFlash forward to early 2020, the beginning of the ongoing pandemic.\nThe researchers immediately realized that the small llama antibodies \u201cthat could neutralize SARS would very likely also recognize the COVID-19 virus,\u201d Xavier Saelens, the leader of the Ghent research center, told The New York Times\u00a0in May 2020.\n\u201cThere is still a lot of work to do to try to bring this into the clinic,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it works, llama Winter deserves a statue.\u201d\nIn other words, the team \u2014 which included\u00a0Daniel Wrapp, a then-structural biologist at\u00a0McLellan\u2019s lab \u2014 used Winter\u2019s antibodies engineered during the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV experiments four years earlier to see how, or if, they would bind to the spike protein of the recently discovered coronavirus, according to news reports at the time.\nIf so, that process would effectively block the coronavirus from infecting more healthy cells \u2014 in turn, showing the potential to protect COVID-19 patients from getting sicker.\n\u201cInitial tests indicate that the antibody blocks viruses that display this spike protein from infecting cells in culture,\u201d the researchers announced via a statement.\nAs a result, the Belgium center established a company, ExeVir Bio, to launch clinical trials. And, on Aug. 18, 2021, those agencies announced in a statement:\n\u201cThe first subjects have been dosed in a Phase I clinical study of XVR011, its llama-derived antibody for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19.\u201d\nIn other words, yes, researchers indeed immunized a group of unidentified people with a formula containing the llama\u2019s antibodies to see how their immune system would respond. Those participants were chosen at random and among counterparts who received a placebo shot, according to the statement. Going forward, project leaders were prepared to administer additional doses to a \u201cmaximum of three groups of 10 healthy adult subjects\u201d as part of the Phase I trial.\nDominique Tersago, chief medical officer of ExeVir, told Reuters that the technology could be a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d Ultimately, she said they\u2019re hoping to create an IV treatment that would be available to immune-compromised people in clinics or severely ill COVID-19 patients in hospitals.\nConsidering that evidence, we rate this claim \u201cTrue\u201d \u2014 with the caveat that the research was preliminary and ongoing, and the actual extent to which llama-derived antibodies could help COVID-19 patients on a grand scale remained unknown.\nSources:"}, "9": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harvard-extraterrestrial-life/", "title": "\tHas Harvard University Launched a Project to Search for Extraterrestrial Life?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe aliens are coming!\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNur Ibrahim\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["29 July 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/07/1677px-A_Sky_Full_of_Galaxies.jpeg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tHarvard University launched the Galileo Project in July 2021 to search for evidence of extraterrestrial life by looking for any advanced technology aliens may have left behind.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nWe may not be alone in the universe, if a Harvard University initiative has anything to say about it.\nThe Galileo Project at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has a team of scientists led by astronomy Professor Avi Loeb that will search for \u201cextraterrestrial technological signatures\u201d that would help them find possible extraterrestrial civilizations.

He would go on to expand on this list in 1990, adding the classification of 78 insect stings to be published in the Encyclopedia of Entomology.\u00a0\nTake the red fire ant, for example. With a pain level of 1, its sting was characterized as sharp, sudden, and mildly alarming: \u201cLike walking across a shag carpet and reaching for the light switch.\u201d\u00a0\nBumping up to level 2, we see the western honey bee whose sting is described as \u201cburning, corrosive, but you can handle it.

As it turns out, Australia is home to at least seven pink-hued lakes, some of which are found inland and others that are nestled against the white sand beaches of the South Pacific.\u00a0 \u00a0\nPerhaps best known is Lake Hilliar. First discovered in 1802 by navigator Matthew Flinders, the lake is located on Middle Island off of the coast of Western Australia. Like the other pink lakes of Australia, it is believed that Lake Hilliar\u2019s vibrant pink color is the result of microalgae called Dunaliella salina. The salt-loving algae produce carotenoids \u2014 the same pigment found in carrots \u2014 that could help to explain how the lake gets its pink color. According to a 1987 study published in the Journal of Arid Environments, the water of some lakes can turn pink during the warm and dry months of the year when brine concentrations are highest. As water evaporates from the surface of the lake, and the body of water increases in salinity, D. salina develops its reddish pigment.\u00a0\nResearchers with the U.S.-based Extreme Microbiome Project, a scientific effort to characterize extremophiles and novel organisms, studied sediment and water samples from the lake to better understand the organisms that call it home.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile the pink color is thought to be caused by salt-loving algae, the actual microbial composition of the lake is unknown,\u201d wrote Ken McGrath, national sequencing manager at the Australian Research Facility. \u201cThe analysis revealed a surprising range of microbial diversity in the lake, and indicates that many algal, bacterial, and archaeal halophiles contribute to the persistent pigmentation of this pink paradise.\u201d\nMcGrath and his team genetically sequenced organisms found in the lake using what is known as metagenomics \u2013 the \u201cfishing net\u201d of genomics that captures everything in the sample, not just the fishing rod looking at a specific question.\u00a0\nA \u201cbigger picture\u201d of what was in the lake revealed that while D. salina is the dominant bacteria in the lake; other archaea \u2014 unicellular organisms like bacteria that make up a different branch of the tree of life \u2014 were also found in abundant numbers, including salt-loving species and subspecies.\nThat same year, SciShow host Hank Green described this process as a special adaptation that allowed these microscopic organisms to survive in an otherwise inhospitable environment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThough the exact mechanism behind Australia\u2019s pink lakes is not completely known, scientists are beginning to understand how such hues can be found naturally on Earth.\u00a0"}, "17": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/china-three-gorges-dam/", "title": "\tCould China\u2019s Three Gorges Dam Slow Rotation of Earth?", "subtitle": "\t\tConstruction of the dam was rumored to also alter the length of days. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["26 May 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/three-rivers-dam-scaled.jpeg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe reservoir of Three Gorges Dam in China can retain an amount of water voluminous enough to slow and change the rotation of the Earth.  \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nChina\u2019s Three Gorges Dam \u2014 so named for the three chasms it encompasses \u2014 makes up the world\u2019s largest hydroelectric dam. And the reservoir connected to the dam is capable of holding such a high volume of water that it is rumored to slow and change the rotation of the Earth.\nThe rumor has been in circulation for more than a decade, and turns out, it\u2019s true. The rumor was fact-checked by Business Insider (BI) in June 2010 and has been reiterated over the years in variations of social media posts and a number of publications that made similar claims. In general, the claim asserted that once the reservoir of the dam was filled, the weight of the mass would be enough to slightly shift the rotation of the Earth. According to BI:\nThat water will weigh more than 39 trillion kilograms (42 billion tons). A shift in a mass of that size will impact the rotation of the Earth due to a phenomena known as \u201cthe moment of inertia\u201d, which is the inertia of a rigid rotating body with respect to its rotation. The moment of inertia of an object about a given axis describes how difficult it is to change its angular motion about that axis. The longer the distance of a mass to its axis of rotation, the slower it will spin. You may not know it, but you see examples of this in everyday life. For example, a figure skater attempting to spin faster will draw her arms tight to her body, and thereby reduce her moment of inertia. Similarly, a diver attempting to somersault faster will bring his body into a tucked position.\nRaising 39 trillion kilograms of water 175 meters above sea level will increase the Earth\u2019s moment of inertia, and thus slow its rotation. However, the impact will be extremely small. NASA scientists calculated the shift of such a mass will increase the length of day by only 0.06 microseconds, and make the Earth only very slightly more round in the middle and more flat on the top. It will also shift the pole position by about two centimeters (0.8 inch). Note that a shift in any object\u2019s mass on the Earth relative to its axis of rotation will change its moment of inertia, although most shifts are too small to be measured (but they can be calculated).\nThat water will weigh more than 39 trillion kilograms (42 billion tons).

The dimensions and logistics noted in the above post are accurate. The dam was built along the Yangtze River and has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts \u2013 almost four times as much as the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in Washington. Measuring nearly 600 feet tall and running almost 1.5 miles long, the dam creates the Three Gorges Reservoir, which has a surface area of 400 square miles and extends upstream from the dam 370 miles, according to the U.S. Geological Service.\nSnopes contacted NASA, which confirmed that the claim had originated in a Jet Propulsion Lab report published in June 2005. Scientists compared the effects of the dam to the Dec. 26, 2004, Indonesian earthquake, which prompted a tsunami that killed nearly 230,000 people.\nThrough a process known as the \u201cmoment of inertia,\u201d the quake was found to have decreased the length of the day by 2.68 microseconds and Earth\u2019s oblateness (flattening on the top and bulging at the equator) decreased by about one part in 10 billion. But to understand how this works, we need to explain the physical properties.\nShifts in mass like those resulting from earthquakes or reservoirs affect the rotation of the earth because of what is known as the moment of inertia, or rotational inertia. In the case of the dam, the moment of Earth\u2019s inertia depends on its mass (water) and the distribution of that mass relative to the axis of rotation (i.e., the relocation of the water from other areas to the reservoir), according to the Khan Academy. The Earth\u2019s axis is an imaginary pole that runs through the center of Earth from \u201ctop\u201d to \u201cbottom,\u201d noted NASA. Earth spins around this pole and makes one full rotation each day complete with a day and a night. But as mass moves on the planet, this shift can slightly alter the rotation, and thus the length of days, on Earth.\nUnderstanding the moment of inertia is also understandable when looking at a spinning top \u2013 an evenly distributed top will be able to better spin, but when mass changes, the rotation and spinning of an object also changes.\nThe phenomenon is not abnormal \u2014 a shift in any object\u2019s mass on earth relative to the axis of rotation will change a moment of inertia, though most are too small to be measured. Earth\u2019s rotation can be changed based on any of its dynamic processes, from winds and atmospheric pressures to earthquakes and glaciation \u2014 any time a large mass moves from one location on the planet to another. Rotational shifts were observed during the major earthquakes in Chile in 2010 and in Japan in 2011, both of which increased the Earth\u2019s spin and hence decreased the length of the day.\nIn the 2005 NASA report, scientists argued raising enough water above sea level to fill the Three Gorges Reservoir would also increase Earth\u2019s moment of inertia and thus slow its rotation \u2014 a small shift of about .06 microseconds per day, making the planet slightly more round in the middle and flat on top.\n\u201cIf filled, the gorge would hold 40 cubic kilometers (10 trillion gallons) of water. That shift of mass would increase the length of day by only 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth only very slightly more round in the middle and flat on the top. It would shift the pole position by about two centimeters (0.8 inch),\u201d write the scientists.\nThe change in inertia would also shift the position of the poles by about .8 inch \u2013 again, a process that is not that foreign. While the Earth\u2019s poles reverse about every 200,000 to 300,000 years, the earth\u2019s pivoted axis causes the north and south poles to shift slightly and often. Notably, from 1999 to 2005, Earth\u2019s magnetic north pole went from shifting at most about 9 miles a year to as much as 37 miles in a year, according to a study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, and is expected to continue a trajectory toward Siberia.\nSo, while it may seem alarming to some that the construction of a dam and its subsequent reservoir has the capability to shift the Earth\u2019s axis and alter the length of days, the concept is a rather normal element of life on Earth."}, "18": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-town-corcoran-sinking/", "title": "\tIs Corcoran, California, Sinking?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe town of Corcoran in California is facing an unusual but growing problem. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNur Ibrahim\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["26 May 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/1440px-San_Joaquin_Valley_CA_Corcoran_Turnoff_2012_-_panoramio-e1622054493374.jpeg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tThe town of Corcoran, California, has been sinking for more than a decade, going as far down as 11.5 feet in some parts. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIf you thought your city had problems, think again.\nFor about 14 years, the town of Corcoran in the San Joaquin Valley of California has been sinking deeper and deeper.\u00a0\nAt first glance, the problem is not as dramatic as it sounds. Homes, buildings, or roads don\u2019t crumble as a result, and the soil dips over a period of time. The technical term for this is subsidence, or \u201cthe slow-motion deflation of land that occurs when large amounts of water are withdrawn from deep underground, causing underlying sediments to fall in on themselves.\u201d\nLocated around 50 miles south of Fresno, the town is 7.47 square miles, with 21,960 residents, and each year, it sinks from a few inches to almost 2 feet. Portions of the town have sunk as much as 11.5 feet in some places.\u00a0\nThe primary cause of this sinking appears to be agriculture. For decades, agricultural companies have pumped out underground water to irrigate their crops, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) California Water Science Center. This occurs when surface water from rivers and canals are insufficient and farmers have to turn to groundwater for irrigation purposes, which is water under the surface that needs to be pumped out.\nNASA scientists have been tracking subsidence in Corcoran for years using radar and satellite technology. Satellite imagery showed that Corcoran has sunk only 4 feet in some areas since 2015, but a water management agency estimates that the area will sink another 6 to 11 feet over the next 19 years.\u00a0\nThe sinking resulted in a range of infrastructure problems for the residents of Corcoran and for farmers, including crushing the casings of four drinking-water wells used by the city. Re-drilling new wells costs hundreds of thousands of dollars pulled from city taxes. More than a million dollars was spent over a decade to construct lift stations that pumped water through ditches because the sinking land prevented water from flowing naturally. Farmers have borne those costs.\u00a0\nThis phenomenon is not limited to Corcoran. Subsidence is occurring in parts of Houston-Galveston in Texas, and in Arizona, Louisiana, and New Jersey.\u00a0\nCorcoran relies largely on agriculture with 30 percent of the town\u2019s working-age residents in the farming industry, and more than 30 percent of residents living in poverty.

At the time of this writing, the video had been upvoted more than 66,000 times.\n\nSnopes readers asked our team to verify whether it was true that hyalite opal glowed bright green under ultraviolet (UV) light, and we determined this to be true. Hyalite opal is a gemstone that was first characterized by German geologist Abraham Werner in 1794 while its uniquely fluorescing characteristics were described by Otto Fl\u00f6rke in in 1973 \u2014 and new classifications of the vibrant gem have been discovered in the decades since. In 2013, a new type known as Mexican hyalite opal was discovered in the Mexican State of Zacatecas, a geologically active region near the Sierra Madre Occidental Volcanic Province.\n\u201cThis material possesses spectacular color behavior, appearing near-colorless or pale-to-moderate yellow in incandescent light and vivid greenish-yellow to yellowish-green in indirect sunlight,\u201d wrote researchers describing the find in The Journal of Gemmology.\nHyalite opal is composed primarily of silica and is created through a series of volcanic processes deposited over millions of years from \u201csuper-volcanoes\u201d similar to those found in Yellowstone National Park. During eruptions, some lava that chills in a large depression known as a caldera create siliceous volcanic glass that is then shattered into tiny shards and settles with pumice fragments and volcanic ash to make what is known as \u201ctuff.\u201d Over time, these tuffs condense and mix with other materials, including silica and uranium, and settle into layers below the Earth\u2019s surface. Silica and uranium are eventually incorporated into emanating vapors and interact with emerging water from hot springs, and as they descend, eventually combine and redeposit as opal, chalcedony, or quartz.\u00a0\nThese trace amounts of uranium in the silica create a radioactive element that is both visible under UV light and detected with a Geiger counter, as seen in the below video shared by Indiana jeweler Moriarty\u2019s Gem Art:\u00a0\nOpal is generally known for its fluorescence when put under UV light, but Mexican hyalite opal is unique in that it can also fluoresce in natural light. These types of gems are \u201ctruly rare\u201d and after their discovery nearly a decade ago, they began attracting attention because of their \u201cnoticeable change\u201d from light colors to vivid green in indirect sunlight \u2014 a unique property that granted them the nickname, \u201cElectric Opal.\u201d\u00a0\nThe radioactivity level of hyalite opal is in background levels and does not pose harm to human health, but some items that include uranium can emit low levels of radiation for thousands of years, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This has been found to be the case in American products that were made to contain certain radioactive materials for their color-inducing or fluorescing properties before scientists largely understood the health effects of radiation.\u00a0\nTake \u201cVaseline glass.\u201d For centuries, glassmakers would use small amounts of uranium to create dish ware named for its yellow or green tint that, when put under a UV light, caused the glass to glow.\u00a0\n\u201cUranium has been incorporated as a coloring agent in glass since its discovery as a new mineral in 1789. The use of uranium for coloring glassware was especially popular from about 1910 to 1940 for light yellow Vaseline glass and dark green Depression glass,\u201d noted the Health Physics Society, a nonprofit science organization. \u201cThese pieces of glassware are now collectors\u2019 items found in antique shops everywhere.\u201d\u00a0\nBut the EPA largely prohibited U.S. glassmakers and ceramic producers from using radionuclides like uranium for color in 1970, according to the EPA.\u00a0"}, "21": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/chinese-rocket-land/", "title": "\tWas A Chinese Rocket Falling to Earth, and No One Knew Where It Would Crash?", "subtitle": "\t\tAn astrophysicist compared the landing to possibly \"be the equivalent of a small plane crash scattered over 100 miles.\"\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJessica Lee\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["10 May 2021", "4 May 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/GettyImages-1232586990-scaled-e1620140240298.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tIn early May 2021, part of a Chinese rocket fell to Earth, and it was not entirely clear where the debris would land.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn May 2021, narrators in viral TikTok videos claimed a portion of a massive Chinese rocket had left Earth\u2019s orbit and was falling back to the planet where it would eventually land within the next couple weeks.\nThe catch?\u00a0\u201cNo one knows where it\u2019s going to crash,\u201d one video claimed.\n\nThe underlying assertion was true.

Here\u2019s how The Associated Press covered the event:\nMinutes after the launch, the fairing opened to expose the Tianhe atop the core stage of the rocket, with the characters for \u201cChina Manned Space\u201d emblazoned on its exterior. Soon after, it separated from the rocket, which will orbit for about a week before falling to Earth, and minutes after that, opened its solar arrays to provide a steady energy source.\nMinutes after the launch, the fairing opened to expose the Tianhe atop the core stage of the rocket, with the characters for \u201cChina Manned Space\u201d emblazoned on its exterior.

Instead of following a predetermined path, however, the portion of the space vehicle traveled in an \u201cuncontrolled\u201d manner \u2014 without an exact landing spot or course in mind.\n\u201cHuge rocket looks set for uncontrolled reentry following Chinese space station launch,\u201d tweeted Andrew Jones, a journalist for SpaceNews.\nFurthermore, the Aerospace Corporation, a U.S. research and development center, performed its own analysis of the object\u2019s orbit and predicted that it would reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere on May 10, plus or minus roughly two days.\n\nHowever, exactly where that would happen \u2014 or how much of the rocket would disintegrate while descending to Earth \u2014 remained unknown.\nSpaceNews, a credible source of news about the global space industry, reported on April 30 (one day after the rocket\u2019s launch from the Wenchang Launch Center on the island of Hainan) that while much of the object would burn up, some debris could remain intact and rain anywhere between the northern latitude lines of New York, Madrid and Beijing and southern locations of Chile and Wellington, New Zealand.\n\u201cWhere and when the new Long March 5B stage will land is impossible to predict. The decay of its orbit will increase as atmospheric drag brings it down into more denser,\u201d the article by Jones read. \u201cThe most likely event will see any debris surviving the intense heat of reentry falling into the oceans or uninhabited areas, but the risk remains of damage to people or property.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University,\u00a0told The Guardian\u00a0the rocket\u2019s landing could \u201cbe the equivalent of a small plane crash scattered over 100 miles,\u201d and the\u00a0debris would most likely land into the ocean considering Earth\u2019s land-to-sea ratio.\nOn May 4, the European Union\u2019s Space Surveillance and Tracking agency (EUSST), a consortium of European countries that studies space objects orbiting Earth, said it was also monitoring the object\u2019s trajectory.\n\u201cOur sensor network is observing the object in order to narrow downtime re-entry window expected in the coming days,\u201d the agency tweeted.\n\nAll of those predictions ended on May 9 around 10:24 a.m. Beijing time, when social media users in Jordan, Oman, and Saudi Arabia posted footage of the debris in the sky, and the Chinese space agency said the \u201cvast majority of items were burned beyond recognition during the reentry process,\u201d according to The Associated Press.\nIf, or to what extent, any pieces landed on any of Maldives\u2019 roughly 1,200 islands remained unknown.\nIt was not a first-of-its-kind event. Over the course of 50 or 60 incidents annually, objects weighing an average of 100 tons total reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a similar uncontrolled way, Holger Krag, of the European Space Agency, told SpaceNews.\u00a0\nHowever, since 1990, no space agency had deliberately left an object weighing more than 10 tons in orbit and allowed it to reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere with no clear landing plan, according to the news reports.\u00a0Experts believe the core of the Long March 5B weighs about 21 metric tons.\nConsidering the many unknowns of the rocket debris\u2019 landing in spring 2021, scientists outside of China criticized the space expedition. NASA Administrator Sen. Bill Nelson, for example, issued the below-displayed statement saying: \u201cIt is clear that China is failing to meet responsible standards regarding their space debris.\u201d\n\nIn response, China\u2019s government defended its actions. News outlets including The Washington Post said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said:\n\u201cChina has been closely tracking its trajectory and issued statements on the re-entry situation in advance,\u201d Chunying said. \u201cThere has been no report of harm on the ground. China also shares the results of re-entry predictions through international cooperation mechanisms.\u201d\nIn sum, considering credible observations of the object\u2019s trajectory, as well as reports that confirmed unknowns of its descent to Earth before May 9, we rate this claim \u201ctrue.\u201d"}, "22": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-calibrate-cameras-name-field/", "title": "\tDid NASA Calibrate Satellite Cameras Using Farmer\u2019s Name Written in Field?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe landmark is rumored to be the \u201cworld\u2019s largest signature.\u201d \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["3 May 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/luecke.jpeg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA farmer wrote his surname in huge letters in a field that NASA researchers used to calibrate satellite cameras in 2011. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn the l990s, a Texas farmer named Jimmie Luecke cleared several miles of brush on his land to spell out his last name in letters so large that they are visible in satellite photos.

This claim is true but because the occurrence was first reported in 2002, we rate this claim as \u201cOutdated.\u201d\nIn a NASA blog post written in 2011, Robert Simmon, a data visualizer and information designer, described his surprise at finding the \u201ckilometers-tall\u201d letters that spelled out \u201cLuecke\u201d near Austin, Texas. Simmon noted that although the letters could have \u201cjust been a curiosity for passing pilots and astronauts,\u201d scientists at the Johnson Space Center used the letters to estimate the maximum resolution of cameras aboard the Space Shuttle. The aerial photographs were taken at the Luecke Ranch, about six miles north of the eastern Texas town of Smithville. A search on the Google Maps satellite view in May 2021 revealed that the all-caps letters \u2014 which spanned more than three miles long \u2014 were still visible from space.\nA study published in the International Journal of Remote Sensing in 2002 noted that the \u201cLuecke\u201d letters served as a test pattern for estimating spatial resolution, which is described as the level of detail a satellite sensor \u201csees\u201d Earth, or the size of its individual pixels on the Earth\u2019s surface, according to NASA.\n\u201cWe also made an empirical estimate of spatial resolution for lower contrast vegetation boundaries. By clearing forest so that a pattern would be visible to landing aircraft, a landowner outside Austin, Texas, created a target that is also useful for evaluating spatial resolution of astronaut photographs,\u201d wrote the space scientists at the time. \u201cThe forest was selectively cleared in order to spell the landowner\u2019s name \u2018LUECKE\u2019 with the remaining trees.\u201d\nAccording to local surveyors who planned the clearing, the plan was to create letters that measured 3,100 by 1,700 feet. The letters were photographed by a space shuttle at an altitude of 337 miles with a 250-millimeter lens. Each individual pixel represented an area of between 88 and 104 feet. (You can explore the farm in greater detail by clicking this Google Earth link.)\nConde Nast Traveler reported in 2016 that local landowner Jimmie Luecke bulldozed the brush on his land in the 1990s and left behind his terrestrial namesake and the \u201cworld\u2019s largest signature,\u201d which just so happens to lie along major flight paths out of Houston. Atlas Obscura noted that the geoglyphs could serve an agricultural purpose known as alley cropping, cropping, which uses strips of trees to divide pieces of farmland, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Previously, a computer algorithm misidentified the planet.\nKepler-1649c is 1.06 times larger than Earth, and receives about three-quarters the amount of light, which suggests that the exoplanet may have a similar temperature to our planet. Exoplanets like Kepler-1649c orbit around other stars, whereas all of the planets in our solar system orbit around the Sun.\nWhile Kepler-1649c is outside of our solar system, it orbits within its star\u2019s habitable zone, otherwise known as the \u201cGoldilocks zone.\u201d This means that the area where a rocky planet is orbiting is neither too hot nor too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface.\n\u201cThis intriguing, distant world gives us even greater hope that a second Earth lies among the stars, waiting to be found,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, in a news release. \u201cThe data gathered by missions like Kepler and our Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will continue to yield amazing discoveries as the science community refines its abilities to look for promising planets year after year.\u201d\nScientists note that there is still much that is unknown about Kepler-1649c, like the makeup of its atmosphere, which could affect its temperature.

We obtained a copy of the study\u2019s summary, titled \u201cCardiac Effects of Repeated Weightlessness During Extreme During Swimming Compared With Spaceflight,\u201d which was published on March 29, 2021, and explained the key findings of the research project attempting to determine the effect of Earth\u2019s gravitational pull on the human cardiovascular system.\nLed by Dr. Benjamin Levine, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Texas Health Presbyterian Dallas, the researchers analyzed the left ventricle (LV) of two people\u2019s hearts: Kelly\u2019s and that of Beno\u00eet Lecomte, a long-distance endurance swimmer who attempted to cross the Pacific Ocean in 2018. (Note: The left ventricle is the biggest and strongest of four heart chambers, pumping oxygenized blood throughout the body.)\nThe experiment looked at Kelly\u2019s heart before, during, and after his space trip \u2014 he exercised almost every day in space to avoid losing muscle mass \u2014 as well as studied Lecomte\u2019s cardiovascular system over the course of his 159-day swim. The researchers concluded:\n\u201cLV mass declined at similar rates in both individuals. B.L.\u2019s mass dropped by 0.72 g/wk (95% CI, \u22120.14 to 1.58) and S.K.\u2019s mass dropped by 0.74 g/wk (95% CI, 0.13\u20131.34) when linear regression is applied.\u201d\u00a0\nIn other words, despite both men\u2019s physical activity, their hearts shrank at rate of about 1/40th of an ounce each week (0.72 g/wk for Lecomte and 0.74 g/wk for Kelly).\nFor the swimmer, that meant his left ventricle lightened from an estimated six ounces to five ounces over the course of his long swim.\u00a0\u201cI was just shocked,\u201d Levine told The New York Times of that finding. \u201cI really thought that his heart was going to get bigger. This was a lot of exercise that he\u2019s doing.\u201d\nAs for the astronaut, his heart size similarly decreased, showing a 27% decline in mass overall, as shown via the study\u2019s graph documenting the sizes of the two men\u2019s left ventricle over time (displayed below). Kelly\u2019s left ventricle went from 6.7 ounces to 4.9 ounces after the space trip, according to the experiment.\n\n\u201cHis heart adapted to the reduced gravity,\u201d Levine told The New York Times. \u201cIt didn\u2019t become dysfunctional, the excess capacity didn\u2019t get reduced to a critical level.

In the immediate aftermath, some politicians attempted to blame the power outages on environmental policies such as the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d (a policy that was never enacted) and on green energy sources such as wind turbines (a mostly false claim). On social media, this argument was countered by people who claimed that wind turbines can function properly in extremely cold regions such as Antarctica.\u00a0\n\nThis is a genuine photograph of functioning wind turbines in Antarctica.\u00a0\nThis photograph was taken at the Princess Elisabeth Antarctica base, a zero-emission polar research center that is powered by solar and wind energy. Here\u2019s how Antarcticstation.org explains the green energy set-up at this arctic research base:\nWhile the sun never sets in Antarctica for one half of the year, it never rises for the other half. This means that, in order to function properly during the Antarctic winter, the Princess Elisabeth Station needed a second source of energy that would be available all winter long.\nThe katabatic winds on the Antarctic continent provided the answer to that issue, as the wind gusts from the plateau are as fierce in the winter as they are in the summer.\nAlong the ridge of the Princess Elisabeth Station are nine wind turbines, installed by the IPF crew to complement the solar installations.\nEach of the wind turbines is designed to withstand the most vicious storms on Earth. The blades of the wind turbines can close down in the event of a storm, thus reducing the rotating speed in order to prevent any damage from occurring to the wind turbine.\nWhile the sun never sets in Antarctica for one half of the year, it never rises for the other half.

The Conversation academic research site explains that these turbines are drilled into the granite ridge below the snow and ice, unlike a wind turbine in, say, Idaho, which would be mounted on a large concrete base. These turbines also use special polar lubricants that help them withstand the freezing temperatures.\u00a0\nThe Conversation writes:\nSolar panels have to be mounted high above the snow-covered ground to capture the 24 hours of daylight during the austral summer. Wind turbines are drilled into the granite ridge beneath the snow and ice, removing the need for large concrete foundations. Their blades are maintained with carefully designed polar lubricants, but they can shut down production during intense storms. These renewable energy sources melt snow for water, which is filtered and reused on site to reduce waste.\nThe whirl of nine wind turbines generates the reassuring sound of regular clean electricity on base. While other research stations have to use fossil fuels to keep station staff warm, fed and hydrated, the Princess Elisabeth station uses 100% renewable energy supplied by the sun, the wind, and plentiful frozen water.\nThere\u2019s no need for conventional heating here either. Nine layers of cladding and insulation keep the biting Antarctic cold out, and the pleasant warmth of the station in. Every piece of electrical equipment runs on renewable energy. Even my hair dryer is powered by the almost constant Antarctic winds and summer daylight.\nSolar panels have to be mounted high above the snow-covered ground to capture the 24 hours of daylight during the austral summer.

While an investigation is needed to get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong in Texas (you can read more about the causes of the power outages here), Tom Smith, the former director of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told the Texas Tribune that wind turbines (as well as natural gas plants and other pieces of energy infrastructure) likely froze because they were not \u201cwinterized\u201d and prepared for the cold weather:\n\u201cInstead of taking any regulatory action, we ended up getting guidelines that were unenforceable and largely ignored in [power companies\u2019] rush for profits,\u201d he said.\nIt is possible to \u201cwinterize\u201d natural gas power plants, natural gas production, wind turbines and other energy infrastructure, experts said, through practices like insulating pipelines.

While it may take luck to witness such an event on human time scales, on geologic time scales such occurrences are to be expected. Steep sea cliffs like the White Cliffs of Dover are constantly subject to erosion through myriad processes.\nScientists estimate that the erosion of the cliffs has sped up in the past 150 years, from a rate of about 2 to 6 centimeters per year to a current range of 22 to 32 centimeters per year. The authors of the 2016 study that came up with that rate suggested the increased erosion \u201cis the result of thinning of cliff-front beaches, exacerbated by regional storminess and anthropogenic modification of the coast.\u201d This erosion does not need to occur in small, centimeter chunks.

Here\u2019s a description of what agate is and how it forms from Geology.com:\nAgate is a translucent variety of microcrystalline quartz. It is used as a semiprecious stone when it is of desirable quality and color.\nAgate generally forms by the deposition of silica from groundwater in the cavities of igneous rocks. The agate deposits in concentric layers around the walls of the cavity, or in horizontal layers building up from the bottom of the cavity. These structures produce the banded patterns that are characteristic of many agates. Some of these cavities are lined with crystals and those are known as geodes.\nAgate occurs in a wide range of colors, which include brown, white, red, gray, pink, black, and yellow. The colors are caused by impurities and occur as alternating bands within the agate. The different colors were produced as groundwaters of different compositions seeped into the cavity. The banding within a cavity is a record of water chemistry change. This banding gives many agates the interesting colors and patterns that make it a popular gemstone.\nAgate is a translucent variety of microcrystalline quartz.

Here are a few of the most common:\n\n\nJanuary: Wolf moon, Center moon, Cold moon, Freeze moon, Frost Exploding moon\nFebruary: Snow moon, Bear moon, Eagle moon, Raccoon moon\nMarch: Worm moon, Snow Crust moon, Sugar moon, Crow Comes Back moon\nApril: Pink moon, Sugar maker moon, Sucker moon, Frog moon, Breaking Ice moon\nMay: Flower moon, Planting moon, Budding moon, Egg-laying Moon\nJune: Strawberry moon, Hatching moon, Hot moon, Birth moon, Blooming moon\nJuly: Buck moon, Berry moon, Halfway Summer moon, Raspbery moon, Salmon moon\nAugust: Sturgeon moon, Harvest moon, Black Cherries Moon, Ricing moon\nSeptember: Corn moon, Autumn moon, Harvest moon, Mating moon, Rutting moon\nOctober: Hunter moon, Freezing moon, Ice moon, Falling Leaves moon\nNovember: Beaver moon, Frost moon, Whitefish moon, Freezing moon\nDecember: Cold moon, Hoar Frost moon, Snow moon, Long Night moon, Winter Maker moon\n\n\nAccording to The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, the \u201cwolf\u201d title holds roots in Native American, Colonial American and European history \u2014 and not because wolves howl at the moon. These wild canines are thought to howl more during the winter months, and in January in particular. Wolves howl to define their territory or find their pack, as well as to form familial bonds and coordinate hunting. And in the winter months, wolves tend to be more territorial and defensive as tensions rise to find a mate and resources become more limited ahead of the spring season, according to the National Park Service.\nThe \u201cwolf moon\u201d typically represents the first full moon of winter, a season that officially begins on the Dec. 21 solstice. But the 2020-21 winter season saw its first full moon on Dec. 29, 2020, when the \u201ccold moon\u201d rose in the night skies."}, "37": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/moon-disappear-1000-years-ago/", "title": "\tDid the Moon Briefly \u2018Disappear\u2019 1,000 Years Ago?", "subtitle": "\t\tA famed medieval transcript described the Earth\u2019s lunar companion as \u201cwholly gone.\u201d\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["5 January 2021"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/01/GettyImages-1230255334.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tNearly a millennium ago, the moon briefly \"vanished\" from the sky, likely as a result of airborne debris emitted by volcanic eruptions.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nMedieval volcanic eruptions that occurred nearly 1,000 years ago likely triggered a partial blackout of the night sky, completely hiding the moon from the view of Earth\u2019s inhabitants and resulting in widespread climatic changes for several years.\nAccording to an April 2020 study published in the research journal Scientific Reports, researchers at the University of Geneva analyzed tree-ring records and ice-core samples and then compared their findings to written historical accounts dating back to the 12th century. They found that a millennium-old account of a lunar eclipse was more likely the result of a series of volcanic eruptions that emitted dust and ash into the sky, blocking the moon and causing widespread famines around Europe. The story first broke in April 2020 when the study was originally published, and recirculated again in December 2020 when the entertainment blog Oddee shared the findings in a post.\nThe 1110 lunar eclipse was described in the Peterborough Chronicle as having completely blocked the moon \u2014 a historical account that has long stumped scientists, historians, and astronomers\n\u201cOn the fifth night in the month of May appeared the moon shining bright in the evening, and afterwards by little and little its light diminished, so that, as soon as night came, it was so completely extinguished withal, that neither light, nor orb, nor anything at all of it was seen. And so, it continued nearly until day, and then appeared shining full and bright,\u201d read the text.\nThe writer noted that it was an otherwise clear night sky, which suggested that the disappearance of the moon could not simply be explained by cloud cover. It was long believed that this celestial event was due to a lunar eclipse, long interesting astronomers, historians, and climatologists alike, including George Frederick, who described the supposed eclipse as an \u201cinstance of a \u2018black\u2019 eclipse when the moon becomes quite invisible instead of shining with the familiar coppery hue.\u201d But before the modern research, the eclipsed moon was not directly linked to the presence of volcanic aerosols that might have blocked it.\nThe original manuscript of the \u201cAnnals of Saint Evroult,\u201d which was used in the 12th century to determine the annual changing dates on which Easter fell, may be key. History notes added in the margins described a major three-year famine that started in France in 1109, which may have been the result \u2014 at least partially \u2014 of climatic disturbances resulting from a volcanic eruption.\nTo further explore the veracity of these historical accounts, the researchers analyzed the chemical composition of ice core samples from Greenland and Antarctica. These long-cored layers of ice play a key role in understanding our planet\u2019s history. Climatic events are recorded in layers of tree-like ice rings; and as ice and snow layers build up over thousands of years, so do particulate matter and dissolved chemicals. Discovered in these locked layers were spikes in sulfate aerosols both before and after the year 1110, indicating that a series of volcanic eruptions likely emitted aerosols in the stratosphere.\nThis data was then compared to tree-ring records from the same period. As ice cores lock in climatic events, tree rings grow in response to climatic changes to record the planet\u2019s history. Through this analysis, the researchers determined that during the years in question, the planet experienced more precipitation and greater cloud cover \u2014 both of which may have been the result of increased volcanic matter in the stratosphere.\nBut the volcanic theory isn\u2019t necessarily new. It was long theorized that volcanic events at both poles resulted in sulfate deposition. However, the researchers now conclude that a potentially \u201cforgotten\u201d cluster of eruptions contributed to the climatic events described in the historical documents.\n\u201cHere, we show that a unique medieval observation of a \u2018dark\u2019 total lunar eclipse attests to a dust veil over Europe in May 1110 CE, corroborating the revised ice-core chronologies,\u201d wrote the authors. \u201cFurthermore, careful evaluation of ice core records points to the occurrence of several closely spaced volcanic eruptions between 1108 and 1110 CE.\u201d\nIt is important to note that the sources of the volcanic eruptions remain unknown, and further research may help to characterize where in the world these events took place.\u00a0"}, "38": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/frozen-wolf-pup-fur-preserved/", "title": "\tWas a 57,000-Year-Old Frozen Wolf Pup Discovered With Fur Still Preserved?", "subtitle": "\t\tA gold miner was reportedly blasting a wall of frozen mud in Canada when he came upon the permafrost-entombed canine.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["24 December 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/12/Copy-of-Rating-Overlay-FEATURED-IMG-8-1.png?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tAt 57,000 years old, the world\u2019s most complete wolf mummy \u2014 skin, fur, and all \u2014 was found in permafrost when a gold miner blasted a wall of frozen mud. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn July 2016, a gold miner in the Klondike goldfields of the Canadian Yukon who was thawing frozen ground and mud to locate placer deposits came upon a much furrier, historically valuable discovery. Locked in the permafrost were the perfectly preserved remains of a wolf pup that had died an estimated 57,000 years ago. And in December 2020, researchers at Des Moines University characterized the world\u2019s \u201cmost complete\u201d wolf mummy in the scientific journal, Current Biology.\nNow named Zh\u00f9r, which means \u201cwolf\u201d in the local language of the Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch people, the pup is believed to be a Pleistocene gray wolf who died at the age of about seven weeks. Zh\u00f9r was so well preserved at the time of her death that her skin, fur, and the papillae on her lips are all still visible.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most complete wolf mummy that\u2019s ever been found. She\u2019s basically 100% intact \u2014 all that\u2019s missing are her eyes,\u201d said study author Julie Meachen, an associate professor of anatomy at Des Moines University in a news release. \u201cAnd the fact that she\u2019s so complete allowed us to do so many lines of inquiry on her to basically reconstruct her life.\u201d\nZh\u00f9r measured just 14 inches long and weighed under 1.5 pounds. Morphometric, isotopic, and genetic analyses of the pup provided details of her appearance and evolutionary relationship to wolves \u2014 all of which contributed to understanding how the young canine died.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to find these mummies in the Yukon. The animal has to die in a permafrost location, where the ground is frozen all the time, and they have to get buried very quickly, like any other fossilization process,\u201d said Meachen. \u201cIf it lays out on the frozen tundra too long it\u2019ll decompose or get eaten.\u201d\nBut how did Zh\u00f9r die? To find out, Meachen and her team first needed to determine how the pup lived.\nAs a mammal ages, its bones fuse together, helping researchers to determine an animal\u2019s age. Radiographs of the canine\u2019s skeleton showed that the epiphyses and epiphyseal plates (also known as the \u201cgrowth plates\u201d) located at the end of long bones had partially fused. By comparing it to the growth rate of a domestic dog, the researchers were able to determine that Zh\u00f9r was just under two months when she died. Based on the birthing cycle of modern wolves, it\u2019s likely that her den collapsed in July or early August.\nIn order to determine when Zh\u00f9r died, researchers turned to radiocarbon dating, a method that analyzes the level of three carbon isotopes in an organic item \u2014 like a wolf mummy \u2014 and compares it to the amount of carbon in the atmosphere through geological history. In short, a mummy\u2019s level of carbon isotopes will by and large match carbon in the atmosphere at the time of death. An analysis of Zh\u00f9r\u2019s DNA from hair follicles and oxygen isotopes from tooth enamel suggests that she lived and died between 56,000 and 57,000 years ago.\nHer DNA suggests that Zh\u00f9r likely descended from ancient gray wolves in Russia, Siberia, and Alaska. This evolutionary group, or clade, also includes individuals from Eurasia and North America, a finding that provides further evidence to suggest that the continents were connected during the Pleistocene epoch by way of a giant swath of ice known as the Bering Land Bridge. But because Zh\u00f9r\u2019s DNA does not prove she is a direct ancestor of gray wolves in Canada today, it is thought that wolves in the area experienced at least one wave of regional extinction before being replaced by another subgroup.\nUnderstanding Zh\u00f9r\u2019s relationship to modern-day wolves helps to paint a bigger picture of her time on Earth. Using that information, the researchers analyzed her diet and determined it was heavily influenced by how closely she lived to the water. Her diet largely consisted of aquatic resources, particularly salmon. This particular area of the Klondike River where she was found is a spawning ground for king salmon and a feeding area for wolves of today.\nBecause the pup had a mouth full of teeth and was otherwise healthy at the time of her death, in addition to her high level of preservation, the scientists concluded that she likely died instantly when her den collapsed. But the discovery also presented as many questions as it did insights. Why was Zh\u00f9r the only wolf found in the den? What happened to her parents or siblings? Could it have been that she was an only pup, or was she the only one present when the den collapsed?\nAnswers to these questions may never be found, but viewing Zh\u00f9r has been made possible by the Tr\u2019ond\u00ebk Hw\u00ebch\u2019in people, who placed the pup on display in December 2020 at the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Center in Whitehorse, the capital city of Yukon."}, "39": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/extraterrestrial-material-asteroid/", "title": "\tDid Scientists Recover \u2018Extraterrestrial Material\u2019 from Asteroid 190 Million Miles from Earth?", "subtitle": "\t\tIt would be the world\u2019s first sample of a gaseous material from deep space. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["17 December 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/12/GettyImages-1229959837.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tJapanese scientists confirmed that the asteroid explorer Hyabusu2 successfully collected and returned soil and gas samples from the asteroid Ryugu 190 million miles from Earth. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nScientists with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) confirmed on Dec. 14, 2020, that the asteroid explorer Hyabusu2 returned to Earth after successfully collecting and returning extraterrestrial material from Ryugu, an asteroid located 190 million miles away.\nIn a video shared to Twitter, Hyabusa2 Project Manager Yuichi Tsuda confirmed samples from Ryugu safely returned to Earth within a capsule on Dec. 6.

After 10 years of planning, the explorer was launched to deep space in December 2014 to help scientists better characterize and understand the origins of the solar system, and perhaps even life on Earth.

Researchers thought that organic matter and water could be found on the asteroid dating back to when the solar system was created around 4.6 billion years ago, according to the JAXA Institute of Space and Astronautical Science.\nIt took JAXA researchers about a week to open the capsule and on Dec. 14, the team announced that it had found grains of black sand derived from Ryugu attached to the sample container.

It killed 50 million people worldwide, while it\u2019s estimated that \u201c500 million people or one-third of the world\u2019s population became infected with this virus.\u201d Roughly 675,000 Americans died during the pandemic.\nLike the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, the disease was airborne, but the CDC notes that while modern laboratories have synthesized it for study, the properties that made it so deadly at the time are not well understood. Unlike the current pandemic, the 1918 flu pandemic virus killed primarily young people.\nAs we noted above, the 1918 flu pandemic was called the \u201cSpanish flu,\u201d but that was a misleading term. The origin of the virus is unknown. But the nickname \u201cSpanish flu\u201d took hold because as it spread during World War I, countries involved in the war attempted to suppress news reporting on the issue, to avoid lowering national morale and causing panic during the Great War, according to USA Today. Spain was neutral in the war, and the news media there was openly reporting on it, especially when Spanish King Alfonso XIII fell gravely ill with the virus. Because the Spanish news media reported robustly on the disease while other nations minimized it, it took on the moniker \u201cSpanish flu.\u201d\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, as of this writing, has killed more than 287,000 Americans and 1.5 million people worldwide, sickening millions.\nHolohan made a brief video on the topic, which can be viewed here:"}, "41": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nasa-sally-ride-100-tampons/", "title": "\tDid NASA Ask Sally Ride if 100 Tampons Would Be Enough for 14 Days in Space?", "subtitle": "\t\tEven half that amount would have been more than enough for two weeks in space. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMadison Dapcevich\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["7 December 2020", "8 December 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/12/GettyImages-512027468.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tIn advance of her 1984 mission aboard the space shuttle Challenger, NASA engineers asked Sally Ride if 100 tampons would be enough for two weeks in space. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nSpace pioneer Sally Ride, who became the first female American astronaut in space, was asked by NASA engineers if 100 tampons would be sufficient for the 14 days she was to spend on the space shuttle Challenger in 1984.\nThe story resurfaced in April 2020, when comedienne Marcia Belsky performed a now-viral song about Ride on Comedy Central titled, \u201cProof that NASA Doesn\u2019t Know Anything About Women.\u201d\n\u201cRemember when NASA sent a woman to space for only six days and they gave her 100 tampons. 100 tampons.

Researchers were conducting underwater mapping of the northern Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the planet\u2019s largest coral reef system.\nThe base of the blade-shaped reef is nearly a mile wide, and rises more than 1,600 feet from the seafloor to just over 130 feet below the surface of the ocean. Scientists were able to visually record the reef using video systems aboard the ROV, as well as to conduct three-dimensional mapping \u2014 a combination that together helps the scientific community to better understand the broader ecosystem.\n\u201cTo find a new half-a-kilometer tall reef in the offshore Cape York area of the well-recognized Great Barrier Reef shows how mysterious the world is just beyond our coastline,\u201d said Jyotika Virmani, executive director of Schmidt Ocean Institute. \u201cThis powerful combination of mapping data and underwater imagery will be used to understand this new reef and its role within the incredible Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\nMade up of around 3,000 individual reefs, the Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth, and is visible from space, according to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. Though its scale is massive, it is actually made up of millions of tiny organisms known as coral polyps that collectively build larger colonies generally known as corals.\nThese \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d that provide life to about one-quarter of the oceans\u2019 fish species. Iconic to the Great Barrier Reef, shallow water corals form symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae called zooxanthellae that live in the tissue of coral and provide the brightly colored hues associated with shallow corals. Coral provides a home to the zooxanthellae, which in turn photosynthesize sunlight to produce carbohydrates and food for their hose.\nDeep-sea corals like those found by Falkor live in deeper, darker, and colder waters, where light often does not reach. These corals do not rely on photosynthesis for food, but rather capture and prey upon plankton and organic matter that drift in the water column.\n\u201cThis unexpected discovery affirms that we continue to find unknown structures and new species in our Ocean,\u201d said Wendy Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Ocean Institute. \u201cThe state of our knowledge about what\u2019s in the ocean has long been so limited. Thanks to new technologies that work as our eyes, ears and hands in the deep ocean, we have the capacity to explore like never before. New oceanscapes are opening to us, revealing the ecosystems and diverse life forms that share the planet with us.\u201d\nThe reef was unnamed as of the time of this writing, and it joins seven other detached tall reefs in the area that have been mapped since the 19th century."}, "47": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/petri-dishes-coughed-on-mask/", "title": "\tAre These Petri Dishes Coughed On With and Without a Mask?", "subtitle": "\t\tThis visual aid did not involve a person with COVID-19.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDan Evon\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["1 July 2020", "28 May 2020"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2020/05/Featured-Image-Templates28.png?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tA photograph shows one petri dish that was coughed on by a person not wearing a mask and another petri dish coughed on by the same person wearing a mask. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn May 2020, a photograph started to circulate on social media supposedly showing a petri dish that was coughed on by a person not wearing a mask and a petri dish coughed on by the same person wearing a mask:\n\nAs the Twitter user noted, this image reportedly was taken by lab technician Katie Corley and shared to her public Facebook page.

Rather, it was a simple demonstration to show how masks lessened the spread of respiratory droplets, which can carry the disease.\nThe British children\u2019s television show \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d also took a look at how much bacteria gets disseminated when a person coughs. While that episode did not include masks, it did compare a petri dish that was coughed on by a man with no mouth covering and a petri dish that was coughed on by a man who covered his mouth with an elbow.\nHere\u2019s how the petri dish looked after it was coughed on by the man who covered his mouth (left) and the petri dish coughed on by the man who didn\u2019t (right). As you can see, the results from \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d are very similar to the results seen in Corley\u2019s post:\n\nHere\u2019s the clip from \u201cOperation Ouch!\u201d (The cough experiment starts around the 50-second mark):\nA 2005 study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology noted that more than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity. Covering your mouth when you cough (either with an elbow or a mask) can reduce droplet transmission and lessen the spread of potentially harmful germs.\nProfessor Lindsay Grayson, director of infectious diseases at Melbourne\u2019s Austin Hospital, said as much during\u00a0a presentation at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy in San Francisco in 2009 concerning research on the effectiveness of masks in slowing the spread of influenza.\nThe New York Times reported:\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a mask to prevent yourself from catching it, they\u2019re not so effective,\u201d said Dr. M. Lindsay Grayson, professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and one of the study\u2019s co-authors. \u201cBut if you\u2019re sick with the flu and coughing and sputtering, those masks do prevent you from spraying those bugs everywhere.\u201d\nThe researchers asked nine study subjects with documented cases of influenza type A or B to test two different types of masks \u2014 the standard, disposable surgical masks and a more costly, respirator-style mask. The flu patients coughed into a petri dish while wearing both types of mask as well as without the mask. The dish was then tested for the presence of flu virus. When either type of mask was worn, no virus was detected on the petri dish.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a mask to prevent yourself from catching it, they\u2019re not so effective,\u201d said Dr. M.

That means, that people who are not coughing or sneezing can be a source of infection for others. Something simple like speaking is enough to generate aerosols that can spread the infection to other people.\nA simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk. The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment. Therefore, \u201cmy mask protects you, and your mask protects me!\u201d It\u2019s a way of strengthening the social distancing that we are already doing.\n\u201cAs we study the virus, CDC has learned that a good proportion of individuals who have COVID-19 spread virus before they become symptomatic and a few people never have symptoms at all but are still infected and infectious.

Or, as Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said: \u201cMasks alone cannot stop the pandemic.\u201d\nAdhanom said:\n\u201cMasks alone cannot stop the pandemic.

A viral meme from the French Facebook page Jadore Les Animaux, for example, shared a picture of a blue-colored macaw with the text:\u00a0\u201cThe world is in mourning. The blue macaw has been declared extinct.\u201d\n\nFirst, while there are multiple species of blue macaws, \u201cblue macaw\u201d is not the common or informal name for any of them. The closest match to that name would be the blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), whose population is not threatened.\nSecondly, as Agence France-Presse noted in a fact check of that viral post, the species shown in the photo was actually a different species of macaw known as the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus). This species is classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the IUCN.\nBut because scientists have determined the wild population of Spix\u2019s macaw to be likely extinct in the wild, we rate the claim about the bird species fictionalized in the \u201cRio\u201d movies as \u201cTrue.\u201d"}, "50": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/cocaine-shrimp/", "title": "\tDid Scientists Detect Cocaine in Freshwater Shrimp?", "subtitle": "\t\tCocaine reportedly was but one of many drugs and other compounds found in some British shrimp. \t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["3 May 2019"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/05/gammarus_roeselii_1200.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tResearchers detected cocaine in multiple, freshwater-shrimp samples across the U.K. \n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 1 May 2019, the scientific journal Environment International published research that found, among other things, the presence of cocaine in \u201c100% of samples\u201d of freshwater shrimp (Gammarus pulex) from 15 sites across Suffolk, UK. The purpose of the study, titled \u201cBiomonitoring of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs in a freshwater invertebrate to estimate toxic or effect pressure\u201d was two-fold: to present a method for quantifying the presence of pesticide, pharmaceutical, and drugs of abuse in ecological settings, and to develop methods to estimate the relative amount of harm, or effect, each of these chemicals poses to the organisms in those environments.\nIn a press release, lead author Thomas Miller, a post-doctoral researcher at King\u2019s College London, said, \u201cThe most frequently detected compounds were illicit drugs, including cocaine and ketamine, and a banned pesticide, fenuron.\u201d The investigators were able to identify 56 compounds among the shrimp samples. The researchers also sampled the water in the streams in which the shrimp were found. Here, too, cocaine was identified in all of the sites, suggesting its occurrence is widespread and not localized to any one source of contamination. The concentrations, however, were \u201cgenerally very low\u201d:\nConcentrations of compounds were generally very low in both biota samples (parts per billion range) and water samples (parts per trillion range).\nConcentrations of compounds were generally very low in both biota samples (parts per billion range) and water samples (parts per trillion range).\nSpeaking to NPR, Emma Rosi, who was not involved in this study but who has, as an aquatic ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, performed similar work, said: \u201cPharmaceuticals and personal care products and pesticides and these types of illicit drugs have been detected in surface waters all over the world, because when we use them, our waste isn\u2019t always treated properly, and so they come out in rivers and streams.\u201d Rossi\u2019s past work has identified more than 60 pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic invertebrates and spiders in streams near Melbourne, Australia.\nThe question of what effect these compounds have on the organisms studied is a different one. Previous studies have, for example, attempted to ascertain if the behavior or other attributes of minnows exposed to concentrations of antidepressants found in some bodies of water changed as a result of that exposure. One study demonstrated that minnows\u2019 \u201clarval survival behaviors are imperiled by their current environmental exposure to antidepressant mixtures,\u201d and that \u201canatomical variations in body length were also produced.\u201d Another study by the same researchers found that minnows\u2019 \u201canatomy and physiology, but not reproductive behavior, can be disrupted by exposure to environmental concentrations of some antidepressants.\u201d\nIn the shrimp study, the researchers attempted to quantify the potential effect on shrimp using a different quantitative measure based on the toxicity of the various chemicals at issue. For nearly all of the chemicals, including cocaine, they concluded that, \u201cThe potential for any effect is likely to be low.\u201d Still, the presence of any illicit drugs in these shrimp was surprising to the researchers. Leon Barron, a co-author on the study from King\u2019s College, said: \u201cSuch regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments.\u201d\nNic Bury, another co-author from the University of Suffolk, argued that, \u201cThe impact of \u2018invisible\u2019 chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK as policy can often be informed by studies such as these.\u201d Their study provided refined methodologies to answer these kinds of questions. It also, as headlines claimed, identified the presence of cocaine in freshwater shrimp.

His take on the banana is especially popular:\nThis graphic is an accurate representation of the chemical constituents of your average banana, information that can be verified with the USDA Agricultural Research Database, which compiles studies into the nutritional and chemical content of various food items.\nPart of what Kennedy was trying to convey with his illustration was that even completely natural foods, when described scientifically, can sound unnatural and potentially unhealthy, as reported in the New York Times:\n\nAs a high-school chemistry teacher, I made these posters for my students as a visual introduction to our organic chemistry course. I want to erode the fear that many people have of \u2018chemicals\u2019, and demonstrate that nature evolves compounds, mechanisms and structures far more complicated and unpredictable than anything we can produce in the lab.\nThis poster series breaks down all the major ingredients in popular natural foods \u2014 using E-numbers and IUPAC names instead of common names where they exist. Anthocynanins, for example, which are said to give blueberries their \u201csuperfood\u201d status, are also known as E163.\n\n\nAs a high-school chemistry teacher, I made these posters for my students as a visual introduction to our organic chemistry course.

Anthocynanins, for example, which are said to give blueberries their \u201csuperfood\u201d status, are also known as E163.\n\nIf these ingredients are considered hierarchically, the banana sounds much more simple. Like all fruit, it contains water, sugars, starch, fiber, amino acids, fatty acids, minerals (i.e., ash), and chemicals that impart their coloring. Myriad names can be ascribed to the various different chemicals that fit these groups, and Kennedy used a variety of different nomenclatural methods to make that point.\nThe most common grouping of chemicals in the banana are sugars, and in this case the sugars are predominantly glucose and fructose, with lesser amounts of sucrose and maltose. After starch, a polysaccharide chemical found in abundance in plants, the next listed set of chemicals is fiber, another common group of carbohydrate chemicals.\nKennedy represented the fiber as a group of chemicals listed by their \u201cE numbers\u201d, which are codes assigned to substances permitted as food additives within the European Union. In reality, all of these chemicals are either cellulose (the most common chemical in plants) or various breakdown products of cellulose:\nAfter the fiber, Kennedy listed amino acids, a group of simple chemicals ubiquitous to life on this planet. All the chemicals listed are present in bananas, according to the USDA. Fatty acids, the next group of chemicals, are similarly ubiquitous in nature, and all of those chemicals listed above are also found in bananas. Likewise, ash is another way of referring to the mineral content of a food item, and in this case Kennedy used a variety of different chemical-naming conventions to obscure the fact that each of them is commonly known by other names:\nSimilarly, the coloring agents \u2014 all of which are natural \u2014 might be better recognized by different names:\nThe remaining chemicals may sound intimidating, but they too are natural. E1510 is another name for ethanol, which forms naturally as fruit ferments. The final \u201cnatural ripening agent,\u201d ethylene gas, might sound downright nefarious but actually represents a neat intersection of plant and food science. In nature, the gas is a plant hormone associated with aging that triggers the ripening process. In the food industry, the gas is used on industrial scales to ripen a variety of fruits and vegetables all at once.\nIn sum, this graphic accurately depicts the chemicals that comprise a banana, using a variety of tactics to make that completely natural food appear to be full of \u201cchemicals\u201d \u2014 something originally created by a high school chemistry teacher as part of a lesson on chemophobia."}, "53": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/eagle-scout-nuclear-reactor/", "title": "\tDid a 17-Year-Old Eagle Scout Build a Nuclear Reactor in His Mom\u2019s Backyard?", "subtitle": "\t\tThe tale of a David Hahn, who earned a merit badge in atomic energy and then turned his backyard into a superfund site as he attempted to build a nuclear reactor there.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["24 October 2018"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/05/shutterstock_403348783.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tIn 1994, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout built a nuclear reactor in his mother\u2019s backyard, an act that ultimately necessitated a Superfund cleanup.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 10 May 1991, a 14-year-old Boy Scout named David Hahn earned an Atomic Energy merit badge, the first (and likely only) person in the history of Troop 371 in Clinton Township, Michigan, to receive a badge in that discipline:\nDavid was awarded his Atomic Energy merit badge on May 10, 1991, five months shy of his fifteenth birthday. To earn it he made a drawing showing how nuclear fission occurs, visited a hospital radiology unit to learn about the medical uses of radioisotopes and built a model reactor using a juice can, coat hangers, soda straws, kitchen matches, and rubber bands.

To earn it he made a drawing showing how nuclear fission occurs, visited a hospital radiology unit to learn about the medical uses of radioisotopes and built a model reactor using a juice can, coat hangers, soda straws, kitchen matches, and rubber bands. By now, though, David had far grander ambitions.\nThroughout his childhood, Hahn had been obsessed with chemistry, teaching himself everything he knew from encyclopedias, textbooks, and chemistry sets, while personal safety did not seem to be a concern of his. According to a 1998 Harper\u2019s profile of Hahn written by Ken Silverstein, \u201cHe once appeared at a scout meeting with a bright orange face caused by an overdose of canthaxanthin, which he was taking to test methods of artificial tanning.\u201d In another instance, he was held responsible for a blowing a large hole in the wall of a Boy Scout tent after accidentally igniting a stockpile of powdered magnesium he had brought along. His \u201claboratory\u201d was eventually moved to the potting shed behind his mother\u2019s house, after an incident in his father\u2019s basement that did not go as planned:\nOne night as [Hahn\u2019s father and stepmother] were sitting in the living room watching TV, the house was rocked by an explosion in the basement. There they found David lying semiconscious on the floor, his eyebrows smoking. Unaware that red phosphorus is pyrophoric, David had been pounding it with a screwdriver and ignited it.\nOne night as [Hahn\u2019s father and stepmother] were sitting in the living room watching TV, the house was rocked by an explosion in the basement. There they found David lying semiconscious on the floor, his eyebrows smoking. Unaware that red phosphorus is pyrophoric, David had been pounding it with a screwdriver and ignited it.\nAfter achieving the rank of Eagle Scout, Hahn decided he wanted to experiment with real radioactivity, not merely the models he had used to earn his badge. He created various radioactive devices, including two different \u201cneutron guns\u201d that emitted radioactive particles, and eventually decided he wanted to create a \u201cbreeder reactor\u201d \u2014 an energy generating nuclear reactor that actually produces more fissile material than it consumes (by essentially turning material around it radioactive). The concept was popular in the 1970s but for the most part has been abandoned thanks to modern technology and geologic finds that make mining uranium more cost-efficient. The breeder reactor concept was described by the Department of Energy in 1971 as follows:\nA breeder is a reactor that produces more fuel than it consumes \u2026 If the breeder can be used in a nuclear power plant, it can provide the heat needed for the generation of electricity and simultaneously produce an excess of fissionable material that can be used to fuel other plants. The answer to this apparent contradiction is that breeder reactors do not give \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, but produce usable fissionable material from comparatively useless fertile material at a greater rate than the original fuel in the reactor is consumed in the fissioning process.\nA breeder is a reactor that produces more fuel than it consumes \u2026 If the breeder can be used in a nuclear power plant, it can provide the heat needed for the generation of electricity and simultaneously produce an excess of fissionable material that can be used to fuel other plants. The answer to this apparent contradiction is that breeder reactors do not give \u201csomething for nothing\u201d, but produce usable fissionable material from comparatively useless fertile material at a greater rate than the original fuel in the reactor is consumed in the fissioning process.\nThe obvious question is how would an adolescent working out of his mother\u2019s potting shed acquire fissile material to play around with? This is where Hahn\u2019s myopic focus and determination really shined: Many household products (and even more in the 1990s) contain radioactive material, but the problem is scale. Hahn exploited several commonly found products and used his knowledge of chemistry to extract and concentrate it to create radioactivity at levels \u201cnot found in nature.\u201d\nEarly on, one common source of Hahn\u2019s radioactive material came from household smoke detectors, which contain extremely small amounts of the radioactive isotope americium-241 as part of the mechanism that detects smoke. He \u201ccontacted smoke-detector companies and claimed that he needed a large number of the devices for a school project.\u201d\nTo obtain the radioactive isotope thorium-232, Hahn recalled a fact he had learned as an Eagle Scout: that the mantle of gas lanterns contains traces of the radioactive material. So he purchased \u201cthousands of lantern mantles from surplus stores and, using the blowtorch, reduced them into a pile of ash.\u201d This method produced radiation levels \u201c9,000 times the level found in nature and 170 times the level that requires [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] licensing.\u201d\nRadium-226, he learned, was found in the paint of antique luminescent clocks. Hahn was able to find an antique can of the mildly radioactive paint in a clock at a nearby antique store, which he used to isolate the isotope for experiments. Tritium, he found, was used as a component of glow-in-the-dark gun and bow sights, which he repeatedly purchased and returned as part of a scheme to collect the material. Hahn \u201cremoved the tritium contained in a waxy substance inside the sights, and then, using a variety of pseudonyms, returned the sights to the store or manufacturer for repair\u2014each time collecting another tiny quantity of tritium.\u201d\nThese purchases were not the only instances in which Hahn employed subterfuge to obtain radioactive material. Claiming to be a professor, he once wrote to a Czechoslovakian firm that sells uranium to commercial and university buyers, obtaining a few samples of material which contained uranium-235 and uranium-238. \u201cIgnoring any thought of safety,\u201d as Harper\u2019s described it, he attempted to build a reactor using the radioactive material he had collected over the years, using a schematic in his father\u2019s college chemistry textbook as his guide:\n[Hahn] took the highly radioactive radium and americium out of their respective lead casings and, after another round of filing and pulverizing, mixed those isotopes with beryllium and aluminum shavings, all of which he wrapped in aluminum foil. What were once the neutron sources for his guns became a makeshift \u201ccore\u201d for his reactor. He surrounded this radioactive ball with a \u201cblanket\u201d composed of tiny foil-wrapped cubes of thorium ash and uranium powder, which were stacked in an alternating pattern with carbon cubes and tenuously held together with duct tape.\n[Hahn] took the highly radioactive radium and americium out of their respective lead casings and, after another round of filing and pulverizing, mixed those isotopes with beryllium and aluminum shavings, all of which he wrapped in aluminum foil.

On 31 August 1994, police responded to complaints that Hahn was in a residential neighborhood \u201cstealing tires from a car.\u201d In their discussion with Hahn, the police ended up performing a search of the car and found:\nWhen they opened the trunk they discovered a toolbox shut with a padlock and sealed with duct tape for good measure. The trunk also contained over fifty foil-wrapped cubes of mysterious gray powder, small disks and cylindrical metal objects, lantern mantles, mercury switches, a clock face, ores, fireworks, vacuum tubes, and assorted chemicals and acids. The police were especially alarmed by the toolbox, which David warned them was radioactive and which they feared was an atomic bomb.\nWhen they opened the trunk they discovered a toolbox shut with a padlock and sealed with duct tape for good measure.

After the moon-suited workers dismantled the potting shed with electric saws, they loaded the remains into thirty-nine sealed barrels placed aboard a semitrailer bound for Envirocare, a dump facility located in the middle of the Great Salt Lake Desert. There, the remains of [Hahn\u2019s] experiments were entombed along with tons of low-level radioactive debris from the government\u2019s atomic-bomb factories, plutonium-production facilities, and contaminated industrial sites.\nA Superfund cleanup took place between June 26 and 28 at a cost of about $60,000.

He enlisted in the armed forces and spent four years in the U.S. Navy followed by some time in the Marines Corps before returning to his home state of Michigan. In 2007 the FBI investigated claims that Hahn was storing radioactive material in his apartment. In an interview with the FBI, Hahn described his honorable discharge from the military and his struggles with paranoid schizophrenia in the years following his return home:\nHahn advised that prior to joining the Navy in May, 1997, he got into trouble for stealing tires and rims from a vehicle. Hahn stated he was in the Navy for approximately five and a half years as a internal communication specialist as well as various other positions. Hahn said he then received his associates from Macomb Community College for Applied Science in Criminal Justice. Hahn advised that he then enlisted in the Marines in 2004. Hahn stated he was a truck driver for approximately a year and a half before he was honorably discharged. Hahn said after a few months living with his [REDACTED], Hahn moved to his current residence. Hahn advised that he does not currently have a job.\nHahn stated he is on disability because he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Hahn said he also has radiation poisoning from his prior contact with radioactive substances. Hahn advised that he is compliant with all his medications most of the time. Hahn stated he occasionally drinks while he is on his medications.\nHahn advised that prior to joining the Navy in May, 1997, he got into trouble for stealing tires and rims from a vehicle.

He died on 27 September 2016 at the age of 39, a death which was the result of alcohol poisoning, his father said:\nCiting a toxicology and autopsy report, Kenneth Hahn said his son was found with a dangerous level of blood alcohol content, 0.404, late in the evening on September 26, 2016 \u2026 Prior to his death, [Kenneth] Hahn accompanied his son to the Veterans Administration hospital for quarterly routine checkups.

By crunching a ton of geo-spatial data on remote Pacific atolls and shorelines, he found that the most distant such point was 1450 nautical miles away from three bodies of land:\nWhile the notion that there would be no land in any direction for more than a thousand miles is a mind-boggling prospect, many choose to highlight a more flashy sounding (but actually less impressive) fact about the area:\nPoint Nemo is so far from land, the nearest humans are often astronauts.

When they saw their owner reading a pop-up book that played melodies, only 22 percent of the dogs sought attention.\nThe study did receive some criticism at the time from Laurie Santos, director of the Canine Cognition Center at Yale University, who said that Harris and her team did not measure the dogs\u2019 reactions to the stuffed animal or the pail without their owners present, leaving it unclear whether the animals were reacting out of fear.\nHarris, who is also the editor-in-chief of the journal Emotion Review, told us in a phone interview:\nI think it would be nice to take a look at how animals react to the objects by themselves. But I\u2019m not concerned that that invalidates the study in any way. There\u2019s a couple of reasons for that. One, emotion researchers really think of jealousy as a love triangle.

Despite the fact that this phenomenon changes nothing about the moon\u2019s physical appearance, the second moon is sometimes referred to as a \u201cblue moon.\u201d Since 1 January was also a full moon, that will make the supermoon on 31 January 2018 both a blue moon and a supermoon.\nCapping all of these coincidences is the fact that Wednesday\u2019s super blue moon will also occur during a total lunar eclipse. Lunar eclipses occur when Earth passes in between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the moon, causing what\u2019s referred to as a \u201cblood moon\u201d when the moon is full. Unlike a blue moon, a blood moon actually does alter the color of the moon to a moody red; without the reflection of direct sunlight we usually see on the Moon, the only light that reflects back to us are the distorted reds that have passed through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\nThe confluence of these events have led NASA and media outlets to bill the full moon of 31 January 2018 as a \u201csuper blue blood moon.\u201d The best time to see it depends on your location, according to NASA:\n\nIf you live in North America, Alaska, or Hawaii, the eclipse will be visible before sunrise on Jan. 31.

The reason for this apparent discrepancy has to do with the fluid label of \u201csupermoon,\u201d for which there is no formal scientific definition.\nThe relative \u201csuperness\u201d of a full moon depends on how close it occurs to the perigee \u2014 the specific instant in time that the moon and Earth are closest to each other.

Over the course of three missions, one uncrewed and two crewed spacecraft docked with Tiangong-1. As part of its final mission in June 2013, astronauts conducted\u00a0 experiments for Chinese school children to watch live on television.\nIn March 2016, citing the fact that its use had been extended 2.5 years longer than planned, the Chinese government announced that they had lost the ability to communicate with the Tiangong-1. While Chinese officials were reticent about what that disclosure meant in terms of their ability to control its eventual re-entry, both professional researchers and amateur satellite trackers later concluded that China has no ability to control the station, suggesting there would be no precise way to predict when or where it will meet its ultimate demise.\nAs the craft is in a low-Earth orbit, it experiences minuscule drag from atmospheric gas molecules, gradually slowing its speed and lowering its altitude (where, in turn, it experiences even more drag). When operational, this process is controlled by small orbital corrections provided by jet propulsion. Without the ability to send those commands to the station, it would not be possible to control its re-entry precisely.\nAerospace Corporation, a federally funded research and development center that supports space defense and reconnaissance operations for the United States government performed their own analysis of its orbit, estimating that Tiangong-1 will reenter the atmosphere in \u201cmid March 2018\u201d plus or minus two weeks. Owing to it its large size, Aerospace Corp. argued, there was a significant chance that some pieces of the station could survive and crash onto Earth\u2019s surface:\n\nThere is a chance that a small amount of Tiangong-1 debris may survive reentry and impact the ground.

In short, that scale matters when making claims about how similar two objects might be.\nAt the visual level, with expensive laboratory equipment, you can create snowflakes that look pretty much identical. At the molecular level, the chance of two identical snowflakes is so astronomically low that it is considered impossible.\nHow Do Snowflakes Form?\nOn his web site, Kenneth G. Libbrecht, the Chairman of the Physics department at the California Institute of Technology and a well-known snowflake photographer, explains that inside a cloud, small changes in the microenvironment around a snowflake influence its form. That\u2019s because these changes force the snowflake to shift between two different crystallization processes \u2014 faceting and branching.\nFaceting, the simpler of the two processes, produces six-sided prisms thanks to the atomic structure of frozen water molecules. The formation of these hexagonal prisms gives snowflakes their famed six-sided symmetry.\u00a0\nSimple hexagonal prisms produced by faceting. Credit: snowflakes.com.\nBranching produces the chaotic features that extend away from the growing hexagonal prisms; branching happens because the corners of those prisms attract crystalizing water vapor more quickly than the flat surfaces:\n\nBasic example of branching. Credit: snowflakes.com.\nThe repeated shifting between these two modes of crystal growth ultimately determines a snowflake\u2019s characteristics, Libbrecht explains:\n\nAs it tumbles through the clouds, the crystal experiences ever changing temperatures and humidities, and each change makes the arms grow a bit differently. The exact shape of the final snow crystal is determined by the precise path it took through the clouds. But the six arms all took the same path, and so each experienced the same changes at the same times.\n\nAs it tumbles through the clouds, the crystal experiences ever changing temperatures and humidities, and each change makes the arms grow a bit differently. The exact shape of the final snow crystal is determined by the precise path it took through the clouds. But the six arms all took the same path, and so each experienced the same changes at the same times.\nCan Two Snowflakes Look Like Each Other?\nUsing precisely-controlled temperature and humidity conditions in his Caltech lab, Libbrecht has created many \u201cdesigner snowflakes,\u201d and can even control the final shape to some extent. Using this technology, he has generated what he calls \u201cidentical twin\u201d snowflakes like this:\n\nLeibrich told by email that he describes these similar-looking flakes as \u201cidentical twins\u201d because, like human twins,\u00a0\u201cthey are clearly quite similar in appearance, but they are not *exactly* identical.\u201d While qualitatively similar looking, that similarity would break down once you begin looking on a smaller and smaller scale. Libbrecht said:\n\nVisually, under the microscope, you could say they are essentially identical. But if you look at the molecular level, they are far from identical. So if you want to talk about identical snowflakes, you have to define exactly what you mean by identical.\n\nVisually, under the microscope, you could say they are essentially identical. But if you look at the molecular level, they are far from identical. So if you want to talk about identical snowflakes, you have to define exactly what you mean by identical.\nIt is therefore conceivable that two snowflakes look identical, but that is a far cry from being identical at the molecular level. The concept of two snowflakes being \u201calike,\u201d then, relies on how the term is defined.\nWhat\u2019s Going On At The Molecular Level?\nAt the molecular level, the probability that two flakes formed identically is mathematically impossible given the effectively infinite number of ways to create a snowflake, Liebrich told us:\n\nThe number of possible ways to arrange the branches and side branches is far, far, far greater than even the total number of snowflakes that have ever fallen on Earth.\n\nThe number of possible ways to arrange the branches and side branches is far, far, far greater than even the total number of snowflakes that have ever fallen on Earth.\nOn top of the impossibility of two completely identical microenvironments for two snowflakes to grow outside of the lab, the chemical building blocks that make up the snowflake are not likely 100 percent identical either. That\u2019s because in nature there is a small fraction of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes that are slightly heavier than their more common form. The idea that the anomalous water molecules made up of these heavier atoms could exist in the same place in two different flakes is both impossible to demonstrate and unreasonable to assume.\nWhat Does It Even Mean To Be Identical?\nThe question of whether two objects can be literally identical is one with a rich history in both philosophy and theoretical physics. Many philosophers hold that the question of identical snowflakes is pointless, as no two objects \u2014 even atoms \u2014 can actually be truly identical.\nThis claim is popularly referred to as \u201cLeibniz\u2019s Law\u201d and it has been a vigorously debated philosophical question, in various forms, for centuries. While the concept would apply to anything considered an object, snowflakes provide an attractive way to illustrate the implausibility of truly indistinguishable objects because, despite the fact that they are all constructed from water molecules, each snowflake individually produces extremely intricate and complex patterns.\nVisual similarity between snowflakes can only be superficially achieved under extremely controlled laboratory conditions. As such we rank the claim that no two snowflakes are exactly alike as true."}, "60": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/can-horses-grow-mustaches/", "title": "\tCan Some Horses Grow Mustaches?", "subtitle": "\t\tSome hirsute equines can indeed grow mustaches; in this case, the dapper pictures do not lie.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["28 September 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/09/horse_mustache_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tSome horses can grow mustaches.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nIn a welcome respite from the unyielding onslaught of heavy 2017 news stories, Bored Panda \u2014 a web site dedicated mostly to stories about interesting and adorable animals \u2014 posted a story with the title \u201cIf You Ever Feel Sad, Just Remember That Horses Can Grow Moustaches\u201d.

New Scientist later recounted that report\u2019s context and findings:\nMale lions are distinguished by their mane, which they use to attract females, and they roar to protect their territory or call upon members of their pride.

However, until now, reports of such maned lionesses have been extremely rare and largely anecdotal.

In addition to the physical appearance of a mane, the researchers also documented behavioral differences, including vocal calls and scent-marking behavior more typical of males. Lead author Geoffrey D. Gilfillan, a researcher at the University of Sussex, observed these changes in\u00a0the primary target of observations, a maned female with\u00a0the ID SaF05:\n\u201cWhile SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour \u2014 staying with the pride, mating males \u2014 she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females.\nAlthough females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently \u201cSaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.\u201d\n\u201cWhile SaF05 is mostly female in her behaviour \u2014 staying with the pride, mating males \u2014 she also has some male behaviours, such as increased scent-marking and roaring, as well as mounting other females.\nAlthough females do roar and scent-mark like males, they usually do so less frequently \u201cSaF05, however, was much more male-like in her behaviour, regularly scent-marking and roaring.\u201d\nDespite the frequent copulation, however, SaF05 never once became pregnant \u2014 an observation that led the researchers to speculate that the behavioral and physical changes were associated with infertility.\nA\u00a0photograph from Botswana of what appeared to be two male lions mating went viral in April 2016, but this photo was later determined to have captured a lion and a maned lioness mating. In discussing that photograph in\u00a0National Geographic, Luke Hunter, president of the big-cat conservation group Panthera, suggested it was possible the development of maned lionesses could be either genetic or a fetal development:\nThe genetic contribution of the sperm \u2014 which determines the sex of the fetus in most mammals \u2014 [could be] aberrant, giving rise to a female with some male characteristics.\nAlternatively and perhaps more likely, the problem may have occurred during gestation if the fetus was exposed to increased levels of androgens\u2014male hormones such as testosterone.\nThe genetic contribution of the sperm \u2014 which determines the sex of the fetus in most mammals \u2014 [could be] aberrant, giving rise to a female with some male characteristics.\nAlternatively and perhaps more likely, the problem may have occurred during gestation if the fetus was exposed to increased levels of androgens\u2014male hormones such as testosterone.\nTestosterone is likely a big part of the story. As noted in New Scientist, a captive lioness at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa developed a mane back in 2011 that disappeared after her testosterone levels were corrected. Infertility, the story pointed out, is a side effect of elevated testosterone in females as well.\nWhile it is unclear what specifically causes the elevated testosterone, Lead author Gilfillan also thinks the cause is likely genetic:\nGiven all five known maned females [in the wild] come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon.\nGiven all five known maned females [in the wild] come from the Okavango region, there must be a genetic component in this population underlying the phenomenon.\nAccording to New Scientist,\u00a0this is not an active area of research \u2014\u00a0so it may be some time before we have more answers about the origin of the phenomenon."}, "63": {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spacex-sending-deadly-pathogen/", "title": "\tIs SpaceX Sending a Deadly Pathogen to the International Space Station?", "subtitle": "\t\tSpaceX is transporting an experiment that hopes to document genetic mutations to MRSA as a way to predict mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.\t", "authors": ["\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlex Kasprak\t\t\t\t\t"], "publish-date": ["13 February 2017"], "main-figure": "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2017/02/MRSA_fb.jpg?resize=865%2C452&crop_strategy=smart", "claim": "\n\n\t\t\tSpaceX will be transporting a potentially deadly pathogen to the International Space Station as part of their next launch.\n\t\t", "fullArticle": "\nOn 18 February 2017, the SpaceX space transport service will launch a capsule to the International Space Station for a resupply mission (CRS-10) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. \nAmong the items contained within the capsule will be a sample of the highly infectious Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacterium, along with a device able to monitor that sample at the genomic level.\nThis experiment is the result of the first \u201cGalactic Grant Competition,\u201d a Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) initiative aimed at providing Massachusetts-based biotech companies access to the International Space Station.

In it, Mulvaney suggested the federal government (whose budget office he is now nominated to lead) might not be well served by funding science research at all:\n\nIt has been a busy week, and with everything else going on I haven\u2019t had a chance to post on Zika, which I know has been in the news a bit. I have received all sorts of emails and FB comments this week on Zika. Some people want me to pass a \u201cclean\u201d bill (which I suppose means not paying for it with spending reductions elsewhere). Other folks want us to fund more research if we can find a way to pay for it. No one has written me yet, though, to ask what might be the best question: do we really need government-funded research at all.\n\nIt has been a busy week, and with everything else going on I haven\u2019t had a chance to post on Zika, which I know has been in the news a bit.

His argument against science funding (and science in general) seems to follow arguments made by other prominent Trump transition team figures: because science is sometimes wrong, or not clear cut, it shouldn\u2019t be trusted.\nIn defense of his opposition to funding Zika research, the remainder of this 9 September 2016 post cited a recent study that cast doubt on the viruses connection to infant microcephaly:\n\nAnd before you inundate me with pictures of children with birth defects, consider this: Brazil\u2019s microcephaly epidemic continues to pose a mystery \u2014 if Zika is the culprit, why are there no similar epidemics in other countries also hit hard by the virus? In Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases. But in Colombia, a recent study of nearly 12,000 pregnant women infected with Zika found zero microcephaly cases. If Zika is to blame for microcephaly, where are the missing cases? Perhaps there is another reason for the epidemic in Brazil. According to a new report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), the number of missing cases in Colombia and elsewhere raises serious questions about the assumed connection between Zika and microcephaly. That isn\u2019t from some politicians website or some right-wing advocacy group.\n\nAnd before you inundate me with pictures of children with birth defects, consider this: Brazil\u2019s microcephaly epidemic continues to pose a mystery \u2014 if Zika is the culprit, why are there no similar epidemics in other countries also hit hard by the virus?

The findings that Mulvaney cites to are summarized in that release:\n\nIn Brazil, the microcephaly rate soared with more than 1,500 confirmed cases.

The NEJM study cited in the release \u2014 a review of data from Brazil\u2019s Zika epidemic \u2014 concluded the exact\u00a0opposite:\n\nOn the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies.\n\nOn the basis of this review, we conclude that a causal relationship exists between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly and other serious brain anomalies.\nAnd, as it turns out, so did the New England Complex Systems Institute. A closer look at the actual reports reveals that the NECSI had been releasing semi-monthly reports on Zika in Colombia since May 2016. Early on, they found no evidence to support a connection between the virus and microcephaly. Later data, however, revealed that more time was needed to see the effects of the virus in children born to Zika infected mothers. In their August report (the final one in this series), they stated:\n\nThe epidemic of Zika in Colombia was expected to result in many cases of microcephaly. However, until epidemiological week 23 (June 11) there were only 6 reported cases. The number of cases increased to 21 in weeks 24-27, which appears to confirm expectations about Zika as a cause of microcephaly [\u2026]\n\nThe epidemic of Zika in Colombia was expected to result in many cases of microcephaly.

This claim has its origins in a September 2015 paper published in the scientific journal Nature titled \u201cMapping Tree Density at a Global Scale,\u201d which provided an estimate for the number of trees on Earth of 3.04 trillion:\n\nWe provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.30 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.66 trillion in temperate regions.\n\n\nWe provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale.

The most common answer seems to be that there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way on the low-end and 400 billion on the high end. But I\u2019ve seen even higher numbers thrown around.\n\n\nThere are different models for estimating the number of stars in the Milky Way and the answers they give differ depending on what is used as the average mass of a star.

But I\u2019ve seen even higher numbers thrown around.\n\nInasmuch as these estimates approximate the actual (and impossible to verify) numbers of trees on Earth and stars in the Milky Way, the claim is accurate. However, it should be noted that estimating both the number of trees across the globe and stars in the sky is extremely difficult, and thus any such numbers come with plenty of caveats and limitations.\nThe Nature paper that estimated the number of trees arrived at a total an entire order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate, made in 2005, of 400.25 billion trees. To arrive at the 2015 estimate, scientists used 428,775 actual field measurements from selected areas and from different biomes, then created mathematical models to extrapolate to a global scale.\nAs discussed by Space.com\u2019s Elizabeth Howell, coming up with an estimate for the number of stars in our galaxy carries with it even more uncertainty:\n\nThe primary way astronomers estimate stars in a galaxy is by determining the galaxy\u2019s mass. The mass is estimated by looking at how the galaxy rotates, as well as its spectrum using spectroscopy \u2026\nOnce a galaxy\u2019s mass is determined, the other tricky thing is figuring out how much of that mass is stars. Most of the mass will be made up of dark matter, which is a mysterious substance believed to bind most of the universe together \u2026\nSo is there any way to figure out how many stars are for sure? In the end, it comes down to an estimate. In one calculation, the Milky Way has a mass of about 100 billion solar masses, so it is easiest to translate that to 100 billion stars. This accounts for the stars that would be bigger or smaller than our sun, and averages them out. Other mass estimates bring the number up to 400 billion.\n\nThe primary way astronomers estimate stars in a galaxy is by determining the galaxy\u2019s mass.

This chart has since generated spirited online debate over its authenticity as well as the utility of its presentation.\nThe graph in question was created by a user named Wipneus\u00a0in the climate message board the \u201cArctic Sea Ice Forum.\u201d That user documented the source of the data and the methods used to analyze it here. The numbers come from a set provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Centers, which is generated daily from observations from two satellites, NASA\u2019s Nimbus-7 and and the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. While the image itself was not created by an official governmental organization, the data \u2014 which are publicly available\u00a0\u2014 are accurate.\nExperts at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center have also noted the same trends, as reported by CNN:\n\n\u201cIt looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,\u201d said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.\n\n\u201cIt looks like, since the beginning of October, that for the first time we are seeing both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice running at record low levels,\u201d said Walt Meier, a research scientist with the Cryospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, who has tracked sea ice data going back to 1979.\nWhile the image that Labe\u00a0tweeted was of a metric called global sea ice area, Winepus has also produced a similar graph using a different metric called sea ice extent. The trends for both are broadly the same, but sea ice extent yields higher estimates because it has a lower threshold for what constitutes an ice-covered grid point on a globe.\nThe first thing to be aware of with this graph is that it is not the kind of analysis that climate researchers usually plot. As reported by Jeff Masters on the Weather Underground\u2019s WunderBlog, the NSIDC usually plots both hemispheres separately:\n\n\u201cAt NSIDC, we generally frown on the practice of looking at the global sea ice extent,\u201d said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, \u201cthe reason being that ice in the two hemispheres tends to behave rather differently; while Arctic extent shows clear downward trends in all months, the pattern for the Antarctic has been much more complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt NSIDC, we generally frown on the practice of looking at the global sea ice extent,\u201d said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, \u201cthe reason being that ice in the two hemispheres tends to behave rather differently; while Arctic extent shows clear downward trends in all months, the pattern for the Antarctic has been much more complex.\u201d\nThe overall shape of the combined plot presented by Winepus shows the cumulative contribution of the sea ice in both the Antarctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere summer) and the Arctic (which typically reaches its highest extent in the Northern Hemisphere winter). The reason for the dramatic divergence this year is that the Arctic and Antarctic are both experiencing anomalously low conditions at the same time\u00a0\u2014 a rare occurrence.\nMost experts agree that the cause of the low sea ice in each hemisphere is likely caused by different phenomena. This year has been especially warm in the Arctic, both in terms of air temperature and sea temperature, as reported by CNN, which is in line with a decades-long trend of reduced sea ice:\n\nOctober and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region, as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cpolar night.\u201d Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered. But this year, those air temperatures are staying much warmer, closer to the freezing mark of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo make matters worse, the water temperatures in the Arctic Ocean are several degrees above average, which is an expected result of having less sea ice. With less ice in the summer, more of the sun\u2019s rays can heat the darker water, as opposed to being deflected back into space by the white ice cover. The result is a feedback loop, and one that scientists have warned about for some time.\n\nOctober and November are typically a time of rapid ice gain for the Arctic region, as daylight hours become shorter and shorter and eventually non-existent during what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cpolar night.\u201d Air temperatures plummet to below zero degrees Fahrenheit and parts of the Arctic Ocean not covered with ice quickly become covered.

Unlike the Arctic, Antarctic sea ice has generally been increasing year to year over the past couple of decades, despite overall warming trends globally.\nThe Antarctic, as a system, is nothing like the Arctic, due to the open ocean circulation around Antarctica, a lack of land masses, and other factors that make understanding its trends difficult to explain. This finding was discussed by Antarctic climate researchers in a September 2016 post on The Conversation:\n\nTo our south, Antarctica has also just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice. After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometres in late August, sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September.\n\nTo our south, Antarctica has also just broken a new climate record, with record low winter sea ice. After a peak of 18.5 million square kilometres in late August, sea ice began retreating about a month ahead of schedule and has been setting daily low records through most of September.\nThese authors suggest factors that may play a role in the reduced sea ice, including changing wind patterns and warmer sub-surface ocean water rising to the surface, but they ultimately conclude:\n\nAntarctica\u2019s climate remains a puzzle, and we are currently trying to see the picture with most of the pieces still missing.\n\nAntarctica\u2019s climate remains a puzzle, and we are currently trying to see the picture with most of the pieces still missing.\nThe final questions of the debate are how valid it is to present global sea ice trends for both hemispheres in the same graph, and if that method misrepresents the severity of the trend. In a post about the chart on The Verge, Kaitlyn Tiffany published this statement from the NSIDC:\n\nThe combined number, while easy to derive from our online posted data, is not useful as an analysis tool or indicator of climate trends. Looking at each region\u2019s ice extent trends and its processes separately provides more insight into how and why ice extent is changing. Sea ice in the Arctic is governed by somewhat different processes than the sea ice around Antarctica, and the very different geography of the two poles plays a large role.\n\nThe combined number, while easy to derive from our online posted data, is not useful as an analysis tool or indicator of climate trends.

With the help of H.H. the Dalai Lama, we have investigated such a possibility on three practitioners of the advanced Tibetan Buddhist meditational practice known as g Tum-mo (heat) yoga living in Upper Dharamsala, India.

A follow-up study also completed by Benson\u2019s research group in 2000 lent some credence to this notion when they found that portions of the brain responsible for some autosomatic aspects of your body \u2014 like vasodilation \u2014 appear to be activated when subjects practiced g tummo.\nAll that said, other researchers feel as though the results of Benson\u2019s research have been exaggerated in the popular media, as discussed in a 2013\u00a0study looking to reproduce the work of Benson and his colleagues:\n\nUnfortunately, [Benson\u2019s] findings have subsequently been distorted in reports in other sources, possibly due to confusion between Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales or lack of clear specification regarding the anatomical sites of temperature measurement, leading to general claims of temperature increases during g-tummo ranging from \u201c\u2026 up to 15 degrees only within a few moments of concentration\u201d to \u201c17 degrees in peripheral body temperature\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, [Benson\u2019s] findings have subsequently been distorted in reports in other sources, possibly due to confusion between Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales or lack of clear specification regarding the anatomical sites of temperature measurement, leading to general claims of temperature increases during g-tummo ranging from \u201c\u2026 up to 15 degrees only within a few moments of concentration\u201d to \u201c17 degrees in peripheral body temperature\u201d.\nIn that study, researchers broadly confirmed the findings of Benson\u2019s group, with the added observation that two specific types of g-tummo exercises \u2014 Forceful Breath (FB) and Gentle Breath (GB) \u2014 act in different ways to increase body temperature:\n\nThe findings of our research indicate that there are two distinct types of g-tummo practice, FB and GB, each characterized by different temperature patterns and neural (EEG) correlates.

His scientific view on global warming was well summarized in that 2007 article:\n\u201cThere has been a little bit of warming,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cbut it\u2019s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it\u2019s caused by human beings or not, it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cThere has been a little bit of warming,\u201d as he puts it, \u201cbut it\u2019s been very modest and well within the range for natural variability, and whether it\u2019s caused by human beings or not, it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\nIn fact, Ebell might see it as something to look forward to, an idea he floated in a September 28 2011 CEI blog post:\n\nComplementing the weak scientific case for alarm, many people have realised that warmer climates are more pleasant and healthier. That\u2019s why Americans move to Phoenix or Florida when they retire. If global warming theory turns out to be correct and winters become milder, then they may not be so eager to move from Michigan or New York.\n\nComplementing the weak scientific case for alarm, many people have realised that warmer climates are more pleasant and healthier.

His participation in the EPA transition signals that the Trump team is looking to drastically reshape the climate policies the agency has pursued under the Obama administration. Ebell\u2019s role is likely to infuriate environmentalists and Democrats but buoy critics of Obama\u2019s climate rules.\nEbell is a well-known and polarizing figure in the energy and environment realm.

The seal was so unusual-looking it prompted some viewers to ask if the photograph was real.\nThe photograph is legitimate and depicts a ribbon seal, a species of seal known for the striking types of patters on its pelt that drew the attention of The Dodo. The seal in question was seen on the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington, on 16 August 2016.\nThe photograph was taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and posted to the official Facebook account of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with the following caption:\nWe had a rare visit from a ribbon seal on the Long Beach Peninsula on Wednesday. According to NOAA Fisheries Service, which took the photo, the seal appeared to be in good condition and went back into the water. The last known ribbon seal sighting in Washington state was in 2012. Ribbon seals are usually found in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk.\nWe had a rare visit from a ribbon seal on the Long Beach Peninsula on Wednesday.

Ribbon seals are usually found in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the North Pacific Ocean, particularly in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk.\nAccording to NOAA, ribbon seals spend a lot of time on the open sea and prefer pack ice, away from land, which tends to protect them from predators. It\u2019s unclear what the current population is:\nRibbon seals are very distinctive. Males are dark brown to black with four ribbons of white. females are lighter with less distinctive stripes. The stripes are located around the front shoulders, the neck and the rear section. Young seals are gray and will acquire the distinctive ribbons by the age of four. Ribbon seals have large eyes and small teeth.\nRibbon seals are very distinctive. Males are dark brown to black with four ribbons of white. females are lighter with less distinctive stripes.

When this is burned, uniting with oxygen, it adds about 7,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere yearly. This tends to make the air a more effective blanket for the earth and to raise its temperature.

In fact, the timing of these news clips is consistent with the historical record.\nThe first person to use the term \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d was a Swedish scientist named Svante Arrhenius in 1896. In a paper published that year, he made an early calculation of how much warmer the Earth was thanks to the energy-trapping nature of some of the gases in the atmosphere. Even at this early stage, he understood that humans had the potential to play a significant role in changing the concentration of at least one of those gases, carbon dioxide (carbonic acid back then):\nThe world\u2019s present production of coal reaches in round numbers 500 millions of tons per annum, or 1 ton per km of earth\u2019s surface. Transformed into carbonic acid, this quantity would correspond to about a thousandth part of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere.\nThe world\u2019s present production of coal reaches in round numbers 500 millions of tons per annum, or 1 ton per km of earth\u2019s surface. Transformed into carbonic acid, this quantity would correspond to about a thousandth part of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere.\nThough he didn\u2019t explicitly say in that paper that human activity could warm the planet, Arrhenius would go on to make that argument in later works. A 2008 tribute to Arrhenius published by the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences stated that his ideas about coal and climate were popular and well known in his day but fell out of favor for a while after his death in 1927:\nWhile Arrhenius\u2019 prediction [of warming] received great public interest, this typically waned in time but was revived as an important global mechanism by the great atmospheric physicist Carl Gustaf Rossby who initiated atmospheric CO2 measurements in Sweden in the 1950s.\nWhile Arrhenius\u2019 prediction [of warming] received great public interest, this typically waned in time but was revived as an important global mechanism by the great atmospheric physicist Carl Gustaf Rossby who initiated atmospheric CO2 measurements in Sweden in the 1950s.\nIn this sense, the content and date of the newspaper clips in question are consistent with both what was known to scientists about greenhouse gases then and what the general public was interested in at the time."}}
